[1/12/25, 10:23:40 AM] Jarjolen Jamora: Hi Sir @639173008888 @6582873573 this is the GC for mills and raw sugar operation. FYI, thanks.
[1/12/25, 10:24:52 AM] R Babu: CVC vacuum pump outlet water line to be connected to BTCT either with separate outlet line or connect the existing gutter to BTCT.
[1/12/25, 10:26:11 AM] R Babu: At present water is going to big cooling tower, it will increase the load and increase the blow down to WWTP and this won't be closed loop. Kindly do this work ASAP
[1/12/25, 10:27:32 AM] R Babu: Welcome Sir Alvin and Sir Andrew to our group.  Your presence will make this group more active and improve the plant performance better
[1/12/25, 10:32:26 AM] Daddy Globe: we are hoping Andrew will learn more about sugar manufacturing through this. it's too late for me to learn it. 😅 ‎<This message was edited>
[1/12/25, 10:36:05 AM] R Babu: Age is not a barrier for learning. I am sure and confident with your knowledge definitely you will grasp very faster
[1/12/25, 11:20:27 AM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
This is problematic since elevation difference is small and volume increase upon diversion of other nash pumps cooling water. Making it difficult to transfer all water to BTCT.
[1/12/25, 11:21:47 AM] R Babu: Mill team, kindly take partial cold water to mill for imbibition like last week to conserve hot water.
[1/12/25, 11:22:39 AM] R Babu: Since plant will be stopped by 12 mn and start up by tomorrow after lunch with C mill only
[1/12/25, 11:26:10 AM] Andrew Yu: Hello everyone, looking forward to learning from team 🙏
[1/12/25, 11:27:58 AM] R Babu: Welcome Sir Andrew.
[1/12/25, 11:27:59 AM] ~ Alex Dungon: Ok sir noted
[1/12/25, 11:28:44 AM] R Babu: Tomorrow we are planning to run the refinery continuously and hence hot water is required.
[1/12/25, 11:30:56 AM] Daddy Globe: To our leaders, supervisors and engineers. Please remember, it is all our duty to constantly demand hardwork, efficiency and performance from our peers and from those working below us. Please remember, the sugar that you avoid losing every hour and everyday in the process can be shared to our sugarcane farmers. Many of whom are small and marginal farmers. This could determine whether they will have rice in the table, or send their children to school hungry. To be efficient, to focus hard on the process and on the parameters at all times is our duty to our farmers, to our fellowmen, to our country, to our planet and to our God! The next time you get called out by your leaders, or the next time you demand accountability from those working under you, please remember that you are just doing your duty for our farmers, for our community and for our world. 🙏🙏🙏

[1/12/25, 7:30:05 PM] R Babu: WWTP discharge 2194 M3 in 8 hrs is too much even with D battery cleaning. For evaporator mechanical cleaning water should be used judiciously. Water spray has to be applied for the body having heat and not to all bodies.  For one evaporator set cleaning using 2194 m3 is not at all acceptable. Discuss  the effect of discharging this much effluent to the WWTP with the contractor.
[1/12/25, 7:34:07 PM] R Babu: Mr.Marlow and Mr. Allan please discuss with Skip for the tomorrow refinery operation regarding the evaporator operation.  As per Mr. Reese the cane may be empty by around 12 MN and raw house will plan A battery for cleaning . Hence discuss and plan accordingly
[1/12/25, 7:35:05 PM] R Babu: Skip/Jelyn for your information and discuss accordingly. Refinery will operate continuously with the V1 vapour. Kindly discuss and plan accordingly
[1/12/25, 7:39:49 PM] R Babu: A & B- M/C brix is less, vapour pressure is also good. why any issue. B molasses pty is 55.63, check the B basket liner immediatly. 55.63 pty is very high. Kindly check and report
[1/12/25, 7:46:19 PM] Skip Tan: We will operate Batt-D on water boiling for Refinery V1.
[1/12/25, 7:48:22 PM] Skip Tan: Will check this Sir.
[1/12/25, 8:34:28 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: Good evening Mr. Babu. Discussed already with skip. Refinery will observed the vapor pressure available with batt D on-line for water boiling. If vapor pressure is low at 4-6 psig we will slowdown refinery down to 2 modules only so that we can balance backend material and will not be overwhelmed. Hence have more time to boil further the R5 syrup foe maximum exhaustion until we achieve the target AP.
[1/12/25, 9:33:07 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: Raw House team please coordinate and notify Refinery if you reduce the evaporator for them to balance their operation..Thank you🙏

[1/13/25, 2:52:48 PM] ~ loujchua: Unable to use malihao pumps #12(softener) and #13(raw sugar) at the same time due to tripping of its breakers
[1/13/25, 2:58:39 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: The Electrical team is working on it right now.
[1/13/25, 3:27:25 PM] R Babu: When hot water available from BST and cold water from BTCT,whether malihao pump is required for start up.
[1/13/25, 3:36:53 PM] Skip Tan: For BTCT, no need for malihao.
We need additional Hot Water Pump at main CT which doesn't have power until Electrical team finishes their work.

For main CT make-up, we use WWTP treated water.
[1/13/25, 4:01:24 PM] R Babu: OK. When will be ready. Any tentative time given
[1/13/25, 4:04:22 PM] Skip Tan: Electrical estimated, they will be done by 1600H which aligns with our start-up at 1700H.
I will confirm the time since they are still working on site.
[1/13/25, 4:05:08 PM] R Babu: Okay
[1/13/25, 4:06:15 PM] Skip Tan: New estimate is 1630H by Sir Alain.

[1/14/25, 5:55:15 AM] ~ hanzel malayo: Good Morning Sir @918750599666, if A-Mill will be ready after charging of steam for preheating and draining of water in the steam lines, I think we could switch to A-Mill since cane inventory at tis time is more than 300
[1/14/25, 5:57:00 AM] R Babu: Cris, A-M/C & B-M/C brix is low, with higher massecuite pty, if brix is low molasses pty will be high. Check the washing of B-M/C, B molasses brix is 79 only. Even for B grain reduce the syrup to control the B-M/C pty. Reduce the magma also since only C mill is running available syrup/ molasses will be less for feed. Due to this all purites are increasing
[1/14/25, 6:00:54 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Cmill resume 0600H
[1/14/25, 6:01:52 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good morning sir. This is noted. We've already adjusted boiling at CVP. Earlier there is almost no syrup and Amol. That might have contributed to the low brix. 

Washing at CCBs are already adjusted. We are waiting for the result of 6 am sample

[1/14/25, 7:34:59 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: sir @918750599666 ,we requested mills to reduce milling rate as we are still adjusting evaporator setting (vacuum and juice level) that suit us so that we could mill continuously. Light juices buildup started when exhaust pressure dropped this afternoon and levels were already high when exhaust pressure was maintained to 15psig.
[1/14/25, 7:36:16 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We already adjusted syrup brix to 60-61 so that MJ/CJ levels will subside.
[1/14/25, 7:36:39 PM] ~ Alex Dungon: Noted, we already adjusted  the milling rate of both mills
[1/14/25, 7:37:36 PM] ~ Alex Dungon: C- mill stopped at 1910 H - 1930H, full MJ & CJ tanks
[1/14/25, 7:41:36 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: thanks sir @639319773825
[1/14/25, 8:39:37 PM] R Babu: What is the sugar colour and sediment level.  We have to produce premium as quickly as possible.  Lot of vehicles are waiting for quite long time.
[1/14/25, 8:40:46 PM] R Babu: Hope CVP A both the compartment in line
[1/14/25, 8:41:06 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: 2035H started bagging premium raw sugar.
[1/14/25, 8:41:20 PM] R Babu: OK. Thanks
[1/14/25, 8:41:54 PM] R Babu: What about CVP B 2nd compartment.  Please lined up quickly.
[1/14/25, 8:42:26 PM] R Babu: What is the HG centrifugal washing
[1/14/25, 8:51:34 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good evening sir. Still charging massecuite to CVP-A sec 1. HG station is on standby due to empty mixer
[1/14/25, 8:51:58 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Prior to standing by, BMA: 5,5 
TK: 4,3
[1/14/25, 9:07:06 PM] R Babu: Process team, please be vigilant on raw sugar quality and sediment. We have to produce consistently premium raw and requirement of 60 k is required in this week.  Hence maintain the following. 
1. Consistent juice flow 
2. Mixed juice temperature not less than 104
3. Increase the frequency of check filter cleaning 
4. Maintain SHWW temperature and pressure 
5. Wash water BMA 6,6 and Tk 44
6. Each shift twice HG basket empty cycle to wash the any residual sugar and bagacillo 
7. BCVP both the compartment in line
8. Periodical checking of syrup clarifier working,  check filter working and HG centrifugal working
[1/14/25, 9:08:33 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Copy sir
[1/14/25, 9:19:39 PM] R Babu: Cris now itself mixed juice temperature is less. It is 101 only. Please maintain 104
[1/14/25, 9:23:23 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Will do sir
[1/14/25, 9:55:31 PM] R Babu: Divert either A or D battery V1 to BST. Tank level is low. Cogen 40 Ft tank level is 44 % and 48 %, improved.
[1/14/25, 9:56:01 PM] R Babu: Cris balance BST and Cogen tank level and adjust V1 condensate accordingly
[1/14/25, 9:57:03 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Both V1 condensate of A and D is going to Cogen Sweet Water Tank right now sir
[1/14/25, 9:57:35 PM] R Babu: Divert one of the V1 condensate to BST
[1/14/25, 9:57:48 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Noted sir. Will divert A
[1/14/25, 10:10:09 PM] R Babu: Pressurised tank hot water temperature is 79 only. Kindly check
[1/14/25, 10:10:40 PM] R Babu: Exhaust Condensate return please check for any leaks
[1/14/25, 10:14:16 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Ok sir
[1/14/25, 10:16:05 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Requested mills to adjust MJ%Cane to 105 due to high level of frontend materials
[1/14/25, 10:16:56 PM] R Babu: Ok
[1/14/25, 10:17:25 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Also requested cogen to increase exhaust steam supply and maintain atleast 15 psi
[1/14/25, 10:17:49 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Exhaust steam supply since 2000H has been inconsistent from 12 to 14 psi
[1/14/25, 10:19:49 PM] R Babu: But steam flow is already 296 tph. Exhaust pressure is 14 psi, whereas v1 is 9 psig
[1/14/25, 10:20:36 PM] R Babu: V1 pressure is high for this Exhaust 14 psig
[1/14/25, 10:21:41 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Earlier sir it was only at 12 psi and 6 psi v1
[1/14/25, 10:22:15 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Based on observation sir, evaporator boiling is affected once exhaust is below 14 psi
[1/14/25, 10:23:45 PM] R Babu: OK. Request to increase the steam pressure and if pressure is not maintained even with steam flow of 300 TPH, instruct refinery to reduce one module
[1/14/25, 10:23:56 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: CVP - A resumed discharging massecuite to HG mixer at 2220H
[1/14/25, 10:24:09 PM] R Babu: OK. Good

[1/15/25, 7:19:32 AM] R Babu: Process team, to prevent the sugar scale in the raw sugar after weekend start up, The following shall be tried. 1. During weekend water boiling open the body wash steam also intermittently to flush out the settled sugar 2. Wash the Strike receiver and pugmill 3. Manual scrapping of evaporator scale during mechanical cleaning 4. Water boiling of 3,4 & 5th effect prior to line up to flush out the sacle
[1/15/25, 7:21:17 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good morning. Noted sir. We will start implenting this next start-up
[1/15/25, 7:31:59 AM] R Babu: B-M/C pty is high and due to this B molasses pty also high. B-m/C night night shift average is 92.66 only. Less brix will affects the crystal yield

[1/15/25, 7:36:15 AM] R Babu: C -seed pty is 72, which is very high, night shift also high and today morning shift also high. Today morning two sample pty is 72 plus. Now C-M/C will be high and subsequently molasses pty. When the night shift pty is high, if immediately acted upon the subsequent C seed pty would have less.
[1/15/25, 7:37:24 AM] R Babu: whether syrup is consumed in C-seed and B grain. where are the syrup consuming points in the pan.
[1/15/25, 7:39:16 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: For the present c graining sir, we have already adjusted and hopefully will produce a much lower purity compared to the earlier result.

C seed purity shot up because we have to use syrup since A-mol and C-light mol quantity is less.
[1/15/25, 7:43:52 AM] R Babu: Damage already happened, how come A mol and C light molasses not sufficient for C-seed. Pan boiler should plan accordingly to prioritize the molasses availability for Seed. kindly check the present C-seed base material pty and report
[1/15/25, 7:48:53 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Intermediate molasses were depleted last night sir due to charging of massecuites to CVP A and B. Backend is starting to normalize now since all equipment are now online.
[1/15/25, 9:39:22 AM] R Babu: CVP-C vacuum is low 152 mbar. It is too high. Is there any issue. Already massecuite pty is high, if the vacuum is low, we will loose sugar in the molasses. CVC feed inlet temperature is 65-68. It should be 60 so that exhaustion will be better.
[1/15/25, 9:40:59 AM] R Babu: Hope sparger steam is not opened for pressurised tank. What is the 1st shift steam consumed & steam % cane and exhaust condensate return.
[1/15/25, 9:45:07 AM] R Babu: What is the next C seed pty. Kindly check and report
[1/15/25, 9:50:46 AM] R Babu: Kindly push the juice and convert as syrup and maximise the CVP A throughput and sugar.
[1/15/25, 9:51:05 AM] R Babu: 1st sugar production is less
[1/15/25, 10:02:19 AM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.

[1/15/25, 1:40:52 PM] R Babu: Still it is less. Louj is there any leak and exhaust Condensate wastage
[1/15/25, 1:42:54 PM] R Babu: Sugar production is far below the lkgtc. Push the syrup to pan and maximise the CVP A and sugar production

[1/15/25, 6:56:43 PM] R Babu: Still C-M/C vacuum is less. Is there any leak and B molasses load is also increasing. Kindly check what is the issue
[1/15/25, 6:56:47 PM] Skip Tan: Will check and get back Sir.
[1/15/25, 6:57:47 PM] Skip Tan: Currently, we are looking for ways to reduce the BTCT temperature to improve nash vacuum pump efficiency.
[1/15/25, 6:58:12 PM] R Babu: Since double purging is started, kindly reduce the water wash in C basket to minimum and maintain molasses brix 89+
[1/15/25, 7:00:15 PM] R Babu: As discussed yesterday, kindly add raw water in BTCT to maintain the temperature. As otherwise all pan and vacuum filter vacuum will get disturbed and affect the process
[1/15/25, 7:00:41 PM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
It is still open.
[1/15/25, 7:01:02 PM] R Babu: Is it cold water ( malihao raw water)
[1/15/25, 7:01:16 PM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
[1/15/25, 7:02:11 PM] R Babu: Then why the temperature of BTCT is high. Maintain the temperature by adjusting the water.
[1/15/25, 7:02:49 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: The increase in Bmol level was due to Amol pump#1 poor delivery a while ago. Since the Amol pump #2 was back  to operation, the Amol level builds up and B-centrifugals was on full swing. Bmol feeding to CVPC is on maximum already as of the moment sir
[1/15/25, 7:03:15 PM] R Babu: Divert A or D V1 condensate to BST.
[1/15/25, 7:03:39 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir

Exhaust condensate return for the day: 81.78%
[1/16/25, 2:55:48 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: C-CCB no. 10 resumed at 2330H. Stopped at 0150H due to detached screens. Unable to resume operation due to unavailability of spare screens.
[1/16/25, 5:59:44 AM] R Babu: Good morning Cris. Still exhaust condensate return is very low. Kindly identify the leaks and control the main steam valve opening to rotary dryer.
[1/16/25, 6:01:42 AM] R Babu: C-M/C brix to be improved, exhaustion is less in C boiling.  Still C CVP vacuum is less
[1/16/25, 6:02:59 AM] R Babu: 12 MN to 4 Am sugar production is 3306 lkgs only. Push the HG curing and maximise the sugar production
[1/16/25, 6:03:38 AM] R Babu: Skip/ Jelyn/ Mac kindly identify the leaks in the pan and improve the vacuum
[1/16/25, 6:04:25 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Copy sir. We reduced exhaust opening to dryer
[1/16/25, 6:04:30 AM] R Babu: CVC outlet temperature is 56 deg.C, why. That too in the night. Kindly check whether the water is going
[1/16/25, 6:06:28 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Based on observation sir vacuum is affected by the water supply of the nash pump. Current set-up is using BTCT, when Malihao is used as cooling water supply, vacuum improves up to 129 mBar.
[1/16/25, 6:08:09 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: All ACBs are maximized already sir. Current build-up was due to alternate stoppage of ACBs for screen washing.
[1/16/25, 6:10:09 AM] R Babu: Yesterday It was told to make BTCT with Malihao water to maintain the temperature and to maintain the vacuum. Do not disturb the process operation due to the lack of capacity of BTCT
[1/16/25, 6:12:35 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Make up to BTCT is continuous sir.

[1/16/25, 7:42:31 AM] R Babu: Mill team, throttle the all steam vent and drain in the mill house areas to minimse the steam losses so that exhaust condensate return will be better
[1/16/25, 7:43:25 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: This is noted Sir. Goodmorning
[1/16/25, 8:07:49 AM] R Babu: Process team, 12 MN to 8 am shift sugar production is 6746 lkgs still it is now . Minimum lkg should be 7700 lkgs for the existing crushing rate and lkgtc
[1/16/25, 8:08:59 AM] R Babu: Molasses pty in the 1st shift is high, kindly check the massecuite quality. The CVP-C vacuum should be improved on top most priority.
[1/16/25, 8:11:23 AM] R Babu: Skip kindly allocate Mac exclusively for to improve the sugar production and to minimise the sugar losses. Let him check the CVP-C massecuite sample and check the CVP-C for any leak. Vacuum should be 125-130 mbar and the masecuite temperature shall be 60 deg. C
[1/16/25, 8:19:30 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: we will check for possible vacuum leaks sir. For now, CVP-C vacuum is at 128mbar when its vacuum pump is on malihao water.

[1/16/25, 12:36:23 PM] R Babu: Keeping the sugar in stock, sugar has to be produced.  As otherwise losses will be high
[1/16/25, 12:39:19 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, HG is on full swing
[1/16/25, 12:54:46 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: @918750599666 sir, can we utilize A1 A3 A5 to address increasing HG mixer levels? basket load for BMA and TK ACBs are already at maximimum
[1/16/25, 1:01:27 PM] Skip Tan: Yes but we need to be vigilant not to contaminate premium production.
[1/16/25, 1:37:04 PM] R Babu: Yes I too agrees with Skip. Without affecting premium you can please do it
[1/16/25, 1:52:09 PM] ~ Ronalee: A-Mill intentionally stopped at 1310-1343H  due to the banging sound at the Kicker area. Found 9" dia rock upon checking of Kicker. Rock is came from suspected truck with Plate No. GAF-9866, Owned by Kimberly Pueblo, VIMACA, Hda. Pueblo,.Victorias City

[1/16/25, 6:05:59 PM] R Babu: In 4 -12 mn shift also sugar production should be 8500 plus so that tomorrow production should be 22500 lkgs.  Try to the best maximum possible.
[1/16/25, 6:07:44 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: yes sir, will do our best 🙏
[1/16/25, 6:14:16 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Shifted Nash vacuum pps #3 to #7 and Batt D water source to malihao @ 1800H.
[1/16/25, 9:14:21 PM] R Babu: 4 PM to 8 PM sugar production is 3172.8 lkgs only, why so low.  At present HG strike receiver level is 44 % and pan floor syrup also 44 %. maximise the CVP A throughput and HG operation and sugar production. Let us target for 22500 lkgs today.
[1/16/25, 9:29:37 PM] R Babu: As discussed all critical units like all pan, evaporator shall be in Malihao pump.  CVC, molasses cooler and RVF shall be in BTCT. With this what is the BTCT inlet and outlet temperature kindly record.
[1/16/25, 9:30:21 PM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
CT operators document the temperature of the water.
[1/16/25, 9:31:03 PM] R Babu: Please monitor carefully the DSM screen working. kindly watchful, incident should not be happened like last week

[1/17/25, 5:05:21 PM] Daddy Globe: we need to resolve the management and leadership of that first shift asap. then we can probably resolve 70-80% of the sugar losses incurred earlier. ‎<This message was edited>
[1/17/25, 5:15:52 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: you mean sir the total flow?
[1/17/25, 5:19:04 PM] R Babu: Yes.
[1/17/25, 5:20:50 PM] Skip Tan: Noted Sir.

This was due to partial usage of syrup for C-graining which lessen syrup for CVP-A sugar production.
This happened due to no c-light molasses (used for syrup alternative) caused by stoppage of double purging.
During yesterday's 3rd shift, I allowed SIC to stop double purging temporarily and utilize double purging CCBs for C-massecuite purging. This was due to increasing level of C-massecuite level caused by 5 out of 7 CCBs running. The 2 CCBs are the large capacity CCBs, #8 (13tph) and #10 (14tph), which cannot be completely compensated by the remaining CCBs.

I decided this way to avoid molasses congestion at pan boiling and ultimately mill stoppage.
[1/17/25, 5:25:47 PM] Daddy Globe: thank you very much for the explanation skip.
[1/17/25, 5:26:05 PM] Skip Tan: You're welcome Sir.
[1/17/25, 5:42:35 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: 590 GPM sir, considering that all three CVCs and molasses cooler cooling is at maximum and 4 RVF vacuum pumps on operation
[1/17/25, 6:34:02 PM] R Babu: Good production.  Great.  Keep it up
‎[1/17/25, 6:34:03 PM] R Babu: ‎image omitted
[1/17/25, 6:41:53 PM] R Babu: Pan vacuum pump: 11 X 233.118 GPM = 2564.298, CVC: 81 GPM, Molasses cooler: 380 GPM, Vacuum filter: 129 GPM. Total is 3154 GPM. kindly confirm this to design the BTCT
[1/17/25, 6:51:15 PM] R Babu: A-M/C pty is 80+, B-M/C pty is around 69-70 hence syrup addition shall be totally stopped to B-CVP and reduce the syrup to B-grain.

‎[1/17/25, 6:52:50 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: ‎image omitted
[1/17/25, 6:53:14 PM] R Babu: For C-seed target pty should be 62-64 maximum, accordingly balance A mol and C-lt. If required take syrup as otherwise not required. Maintain C-M/C pty to 52. There are some reading 54-55. Be watchful 54-55 at any point of time crosses the border limit and leads to higher molasses pty
[1/17/25, 6:55:59 PM] R Babu: Thanks Karl, there is a consistent in sediment in raw sugar. 31 sediments really very good in raw sugar. Please be continuously monitor the DSM screen working, we will further fine tune and improve further by providing valves to individual segment and cleaning nozzle provision etc..
[1/17/25, 6:56:43 PM] R Babu: Karl get the details from qaqc sediment level for the last week average
[1/17/25, 6:58:36 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir
[1/17/25, 7:00:38 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We did re-run sir for pan vacuum pumps cooling water and it's around 90 GPM only
Pan vac pump, 11x90= 990 GPM
CVC= 81GPM
Mol cooler= 380 GPM
Vacuum filter=129 GPM
Total= 1580 GPM
[1/17/25, 7:01:43 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, CVP-B is all A-mol feed and for grain we add A-molasses to control seed pty
[1/17/25, 7:03:30 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: For now sir, we use a little syrup for c grain to achieve 62-64 c seed pty. A and C-lt pty at 60-62 range
[1/17/25, 7:03:32 PM] R Babu: Tomorrow we will check one more time so that there wont be any ambiguity to design the system. Hope all valves are kept full open. For designing all consumption should be maximum
[1/17/25, 7:05:40 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: agree sir, we will do another trial tomorrow

[1/17/25, 7:29:09 PM] R Babu: Mac what about basket 6 liner renewal work
[1/17/25, 7:31:35 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: not yet done sir, RM still working on basket 10. After they're done we could stop #6 and check condition of lining screens
[1/17/25, 7:44:17 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: C-CCB #10 resumed at 1940H, replaced all lining screens.
[1/17/25, 8:04:45 PM] R Babu: Okay.  First reduce the level and stop basket 6 for checking and if required to change the liners
‎[1/17/25, 8:09:13 PM] R Babu: ‎image omitted
[1/17/25, 8:10:06 PM] R Babu: 6 pm to 7 pm sugar production is less. Hope 5 HG basket is running
[1/17/25, 8:12:25 PM] ~ loujchua: Right now sir 5 baskets on operation
[1/17/25, 8:50:39 PM] ~ loujchua: LG C-CCB #10 stopped at 2040H due to detached screen
[1/17/25, 8:54:09 PM] R Babu: Ohhh. How many screen detached

[1/17/25, 10:30:03 PM] R Babu: Good sugar production rate. Congratulation team. Keep it up. There is a chance to produce 9000 lkgs in this shift. Try to maximise the HG centrifugal and sugar production.  There is a chance to produce 24500 lkgs for the day.
[1/17/25, 10:38:05 PM] R Babu: Basket No.10 is not in service and hence be watchful on C-massecuite curing, let them run with maximum load with optimum wash.
[1/17/25, 10:45:47 PM] R Babu: While No.10 basket in operation, instruct the operator to monitor the machine operation for any unusual behavior, sounds etc and request them to inform immediately
[1/17/25, 10:52:25 PM] ~ loujchua: Copy sir, will stop CCCB #10 later 1130H to check if the bolts in the clamp of the screena needs retightening
[1/17/25, 10:53:29 PM] R Babu: OK.
[1/17/25, 10:55:32 PM] R Babu: If the machine no. 10 run continuously for 2- 3 hrs then plan to stop mo. 6 to check liner damage.

[1/18/25, 5:13:39 AM] R Babu: Good morning. Congratulations for the entire team for the good production of 24122 lkgs. Great. Keep it up.
‎[1/18/25, 5:20:11 AM] R Babu: ‎image omitted
[1/18/25, 5:21:53 AM] R Babu: Process team continue to monitor the sediment level. It is goo that sediment level is around 33 ppm.  There are some incident even we reach 13 ppm and 57 ppm, those period process parameters to be observed to create base line .
‎[1/18/25, 5:22:22 AM] R Babu: ‎image omitted
[1/18/25, 5:24:09 AM] R Babu: In 12 MN to 4 am sugar prodcution is 3519 ;kgs only. Very less. Any issue. Let us continuously monitor the sugar production. In each shift production should be 8000 Lkgs plus.
[1/18/25, 5:42:47 AM] R Babu: Still the area of concern is exhaust condensate return, process team please study for any leak, intermixing etc. The return condensate should be 90 %. Shortly we are planning to conduct PG test for the steam economy phase 2, prior to this exhaust condensate return issue to be sorted out.
[1/18/25, 5:43:27 AM] R Babu: Louj, what is the total steam consumption for day and exhaust condensate return qty and %
[1/18/25, 5:43:35 AM] ~ loujchua: We used syrup for Cseed graining (20%), also we are in the process of starting BattB
[1/18/25, 5:49:42 AM] ~ loujchua: For the day

[1/18/25, 5:50:48 AM] R Babu: Thanks Louj
‎[1/18/25, 5:54:19 AM] R Babu: ‎image omitted
[1/18/25, 5:56:49 AM] R Babu: Louj, HG massecuite is also 30 % and CVP syrup also 60 M3/hr, but still sugar production is less for 0300-0500 hrs, whether machine is operating at full load kindly check. In the next 3 hrs it is difficult to make up to 8000 lkgs.
[1/18/25, 6:03:09 AM] ~ loujchua: Yes sir HG ACBs is at full load having set the steam pressure at 830-840mmbar and syrup flow is only at 60m³/hr it may mean that the syrup has low brix, liquidation of BattC may contribute to that.

[1/18/25, 7:35:23 AM] R Babu: Good morning sir. Warm Welcome to the Raw sugar operation group. It will add value to our group.
[1/18/25, 7:37:22 AM] ~ William Chua: Thanks, Mr. Babu. I hope to learn from all of you and understand a bit about how things are. Good morning 😀.
[1/18/25, 7:43:58 AM] R Babu: Certainly the group discussion will enhance the knowledge on sugar technology and understand the various operational issues encounter on daily basis. This will help us  to improve the plant performance also on continual basis. Thanks for the support sir.
[1/18/25, 7:47:04 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Cmill stpd 0744H full MJ/CJ tanks
[1/18/25, 7:48:47 AM] R Babu: Still  D battery cut in operation not stabilised. Vacuum in C battery is less only 18 inches. B battery vacuum is still 19 inches. Any issue in vacuum pump. All juice levels are building up. what is the issue
[1/18/25, 7:50:55 AM] R Babu: All operation will disturb now, juice has to be stabilised and syrup flow to pan will affect, subsequently CVP A throughput and sugar production. Already 12 MN- 8 Am shift sugar production is less
[1/18/25, 8:41:41 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: C-CCB #3 sheared lining screen
‎[1/18/25, 8:41:47 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: ‎image omitted

[1/18/25, 8:44:43 AM] R Babu: B battery vacuum is less. It seems C battery stopped for cleaning. Why actually it should be D battery. Any issue
[1/18/25, 8:47:38 AM] R Babu: Mac, 1st shift short of around 1000 lkgs. It has to be cope up in this shift. Push the syrup to pan floor to maximise the CVP A throughput and sugar production. Please concentrate more on backend and maximise the sugar production and reduces the sugar losses.  Kindly check for B basket liner also one by one and A basket also. Periodical checking and changing the liner will avoid the continuous changing of screen in the basket
[1/18/25, 8:48:54 AM] Daddy Globe: who is shift supervisor on the first shift today?

[1/18/25, 9:25:13 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sir, for raw house it's Louie John.
[1/18/25, 9:28:58 AM] Daddy Globe: @louie John Chua, you need to keep doing better on your shift everyday. Please remember, the extra sugar that you lose or produce on your shift, could determine whether a small farmer's child will go to school hungry or with food on their table for the week. 🙏🙏🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[1/18/25, 9:33:13 AM] Daddy Globe: @639150853212 it's maybe the 4th time in 2 weeks that i hear your name connected with low shift sugar production. please try to do better on your next shift. 🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[1/18/25, 9:52:00 AM] Skip Tan: For this morning shift Sir.
Low production was affected by scheduled evaporator cleaning (Batt-C) and steaming of double purging CCB #2&3 (both BMA K3080) caused by high vibration.
[1/18/25, 10:00:53 AM] R Babu: Mill/ Process team, Today cane projection is 13- 14 K and tomorrow projection is  9-10 K.  Hence plan to stop C mill by tonight around 2 AM and continue the A mill till Cane Exhausted.
[1/18/25, 10:01:53 AM] ~ lloyd: Noted sir.
[1/18/25, 10:02:19 AM] R Babu: Monday after servicing start with A mill only. Do not start with C mill. Starting with C mill we are incurring sugar losses due to very high capacity of CVPs and hence start with A mill and once cane improves we can add C mill
[1/18/25, 10:05:02 AM] R Babu: Process team as discussed, do not liquidate both the compartment of CVP A & B. Liquidate only one compartment and in next week liquidate the other compartment. By doing this process team kindly record the observation of raw sugar colour, sediments, A-Massecuite and B massecuite pty and C massecuite pty and molasses pty.
[1/18/25, 10:06:05 AM] R Babu: Once the management target of premium and special raw sugar is completed even we can try without liquidating single compartment of CVP also shall be tried in later stage.
[1/18/25, 10:06:53 AM] R Babu: Discuss with pan boilers also to observe the pan boiling without liquidation and water boiling
[1/18/25, 10:20:39 AM] R Babu: 8 am sample raw sugar colour is high. What is the reason.  Last 3 days there were no colour raise in raw sugar.  It was consistent.  Today morning 8 am sample suddenly raised to 1500 from 800 to 900.
[1/18/25, 10:21:05 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: CVP-C on slowdown since 0900H, due to high C-massecuite rcvng tank and pug mill level. C-CCBs #4-#7, #9 and #10 on max load already
[1/18/25, 10:21:23 AM] R Babu: What is the reason.  Let us analyse Skip/ Mac/ Jelyn
[1/18/25, 10:28:35 AM] R Babu: Pan boilers to be alert and vigilantly monitor the pan supply tank position and quality of massecuite.
[1/18/25, 10:39:30 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Cause of high sugar color is from ACB BMA #3 sir. Due to increase in sediments, lining screens have been choked up. We already did cleaning, now it's back to normal
[1/18/25, 10:56:33 AM] R Babu: It has been instructed to wash the centrifugal basket twice a shift, to clear the sediment, whether it is followed. Apart from that yesterday night raw sugar sediment is lesd
[1/18/25, 10:59:08 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: we do cleaning sir twice a shift
[1/18/25, 11:02:50 AM] R Babu: There is a spike in sediment.  What could be the reason.  Is it due to high level of juice in mixed juice tank

[1/18/25, 2:32:05 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: that is syrup after bag filters sir
[1/18/25, 2:33:08 PM] R Babu: C-M/C pty is 49-50 and exhaustion is very less. Crystal % massecuite is 25-28. This will increase the molasses purity.  Any issue in CVC boiling. Vacuum in CVC is low again. whether vacuum pump is in malihao water or BTCT. Kindly check and improve the vacuum.
[1/18/25, 2:38:12 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, we will make adjustments. Malihao injection pressure dropped thus affecting the vacuum. We already requested malihao pump tender to increase  valve opening, now vacuum is on increasing trend.
[1/18/25, 2:40:12 PM] R Babu: OK. Please monitor as otherwise the exhaustion will be less and molasses pty will be high. As discussed today, we have to be extra cautious and to take all preventive measures to keep our sugar losses minimum.

[1/18/25, 5:37:38 PM] R Babu: Push the syrup to CVP A and maximise the sugar production
[1/18/25, 5:45:30 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, will maximize CVP-A and HG (5 machines running)
[1/18/25, 7:19:04 PM] R Babu: Mill Team / Process team, Just now Mr. Reese called there will be enough cane till tomorrow morning up to 12 Noon. So Both mill shall be continued upto 12 Noon. If any changes in the schedule Mr. Reese will update. So no need to stop C mill tonight.

[1/19/25, 8:43:46 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sir @918750599666 we stop juice flow DSM, since juice overflowed to slurry tank and eventually goes to our filtration station, which resulted to mud levels on both juice clarifiers. We will check DSM screens now.
[1/19/25, 8:46:42 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Cmill stp'd 0810H for weekend servicing
[1/19/25, 8:47:11 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: DSM screen was stopped prior due to the high amount of bagacillo, which resulted in the overflowing of clarified juice to conveyor and eventually to slurry tank. Will do the clearing of DSM screens for resumption
[1/19/25, 8:47:50 AM] R Babu: Huge qty of bagacillo accumulated in the outlet. In tomorrow shutdown kindly provide isolation valve and wash water Nozzle for cleaning
[1/19/25, 8:48:49 AM] R Babu: We have to arrange for periodical cleaning of screened bagacillo.
[1/19/25, 8:50:13 AM] R Babu: The amount of bagacillo screened is huge and hence now we have to find a way to operate Continuously and consistently.  This will certainly help to reduce sediment in final sugar.
[1/19/25, 8:51:26 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. We will check the existing condensate noozle for the sprayer in the DSM screens

I. C CCB #10
1. Screens from Sagay are not compatible with our centrifugal baskets ( height was shorter than ours, as per initial communication with them only the orientation was different but upon arrival and actual checking by PMD it was a bit shorter).
2. Screens from our supplier already arrived, so we have enough spare screens (0.06)
II. C CCB #8
  1. PMD will replace the current unit by Tuesday, they have found a spare centrifugal basket shell from the refinery (cc4 model)

FYI sir @918750599666

[1/20/25, 6:43:24 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir
[1/20/25, 6:44:56 AM] R Babu: Since the massecuite are filled again there should be high fluctuations in the massecuite and molasses pty. Shift incharge should be extra cautious on pan boiling for the pty control.  They should discuss with pan boiler also.
[1/20/25, 6:45:47 AM] R Babu: All these steps and actions are initiated to minimise the sugar losses during weekends shutdown.
[1/20/25, 6:46:40 AM] R Babu: Sugar losses is the biggest concern and hence all should extra cautious and pan boiling should be with tight control.
[1/20/25, 6:48:03 AM] R Babu: Hope to see very minimal sugar losses after start up. Molasses pty should not build up in this week start up. This should be our goal.
[1/20/25, 8:46:14 AM] R Babu: Whenever D battery is not in service, exhaust Condensate return is good.  Please kindly get into the record and check is there any possibility of loosing Condensate in D battery.  Any possibility of exhaust Condensate seep into vapour Condensate.

[1/22/25, 12:50:37 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy, sir. We are pushing syrup to the panfloor for maximum sugar production
[1/22/25, 12:57:18 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: 1245H-Intentionally adjust HG ACBs setting to produce regular raw sugar. As the refinery requests direct cut-in due to on-site inspection by the Control Union. Sirs @918750599666 @639339940762

[1/22/25, 4:42:12 PM] R Babu: OK. Yes 105 % during refinery operation
[1/22/25, 4:45:16 PM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: A-mill stopped at 1630H due to choking of canes at main kicker.
[1/22/25, 5:08:34 PM] R Babu: Karl sugar production is 6900 lkgs only which is far below than the projected lkgtc
[1/22/25, 5:10:05 PM] R Babu: Whether CVP A operation in full swing and what is the flow rate.
[1/22/25, 5:10:51 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. Despite pushing syrup to panfloor and maximizing HG ACBs. Currently, still utilizing syrup for Cseed graining to achieve AP of 62-64 due to low purity of Amol and Clight

[1/22/25, 5:29:33 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: As of the moment sir, no abnormalities found.
1. If condensate goes to the juice side, problem in EVAP levels also MJ/CJ levels will occurs. Also syrup brix would be affected.
2. No Hammering occurs in Vapor 1 line, if condensate goes with the vapor hammering could occur.
We will still see other aspects sir.

[1/22/25, 5:40:15 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Also, I requested the instru team to check 400psig steam flowmeter of A mill. Correct me if I'm wrong sir, 400psig flow for both mills should be somehow equal to the TES boiler to PRDS.
‎[1/22/25, 5:49:31 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: ‎image omitted
[1/22/25, 5:53:07 PM] R Babu: Check the basket and renewe the liner if it damaged or erroded badly
[1/22/25, 5:55:49 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. We are now stopping the said basket for check-up
[1/22/25, 6:23:32 PM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: A-mill resumed 1820H
‎[1/22/25, 6:28:38 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: ‎image omitted
[1/22/25, 7:56:18 PM] R Babu: CVP C vacuum is less. Whether cold water pump and header pressure is OK.
[1/22/25, 7:56:42 PM] R Babu: Hope vacuum pump is running on malihao raw water
[1/22/25, 7:59:41 PM] R Babu: Basket C 8 TO C10 check the basket,  molasses pty is high
[1/22/25, 8:00:20 PM] R Babu: C massecuite exhaustion  is less. It is around 27 only. It should be 30 plus.
[1/22/25, 8:01:01 PM] R Babu: Maintain good vacuum and sufficient movement water to improve the exhaustion.
[1/22/25, 8:01:18 PM] R Babu: C massecuite pty also 49, it should be 52.
[1/22/25, 8:04:19 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Cold water pump pp#2 tripped off sir and we switched to pp#4. Injection water pressure gradually increasing
[1/22/25, 8:05:02 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. Nash vacuum pump are using malihao except for CVP-A nash pumps
[1/22/25, 8:07:04 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. We are targeting Cseed purity of 62-64, thus utilizing syrup to increase cmasse purity
[1/22/25, 8:08:37 PM] R Babu: Why it is happening frequently and it should be set right.  Every time reduction in vacuum affects the exhaustion and leads to higher molasses pty
[1/22/25, 8:24:04 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: we will run cold water pump #2 sir to know what other possible causes the pump to trip. The motor has been inspected and cleared by electrical. If tripping will happen again, we will request RM to discouple the pump and motor for inspection.
[1/22/25, 8:25:09 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We will check the molasses first sir. As of now the pug mill level is high, we will first decrease the level and there we will inspect the lining screen's condition.

[1/22/25, 9:15:07 PM] R Babu: Mac push the CVP A throughput and maximise the sugar production, since sugar production is lesser than projection lkgtc. Everyday building up the stock is not good, we will loose sugar.
[1/22/25, 9:15:41 PM] R Babu: What is the CVC vacuum now and improve the exhaustion.
[1/22/25, 9:16:42 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, we are maximizing CVP-A and HG
[1/22/25, 9:16:47 PM] R Babu: Optimize the wash water in C basket.
‎[1/22/25, 9:16:55 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: ‎image omitted
[1/22/25, 9:18:44 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: already made adjustments on the wash water sir
[1/22/25, 9:20:44 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: still at 137 mbar sir, we increased injection water pressure so that vacuum will increase. Electrical team still inspecting CW pump #2, we will run it after they're finished
‎[1/22/25, 9:22:42 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: ‎image omitted
[1/22/25, 9:42:00 PM] R Babu: Good observation mac. Kindly check.  Definitely there will be some issue in pre or D1. Thanks for the feedback.
[1/22/25, 10:10:56 PM] R Babu: CVC outlet temperature is showing 61 deg.c, whether cold water is going to CVC.
[1/22/25, 10:14:03 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: yes sir, we are currently doing cooling of CVC
‎[1/22/25, 10:16:10 PM] R Babu: ‎image omitted
[1/22/25, 10:17:10 PM] R Babu: Mac, cigar Condensate Inlet temperature is 89.6 and outlet temperature is 99.6.
[1/22/25, 10:17:43 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Currently the cond seal tank control valve is installed after the pump. When the level is zero, and the control valve is closed, the level still does not rise. I recommend that we install a control valve before the pump to maintain the seal.
[1/22/25, 10:17:53 PM] R Babu: Inlet temperature is less, whether cigar pump is lifting and check the level in cigar
[1/22/25, 10:18:09 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: we will check this one sir
[1/22/25, 10:19:16 PM] ~ Justine Cientos: Copy sir. We will also backwash the Condensate PHE.
[1/22/25, 10:21:20 PM] R Babu: OK. Even the Inlet temp is also less.
[1/22/25, 10:22:56 PM] R Babu: When the seal tank level is low, when control valve  closes,  level has to raise. Whether valve is passing.
[1/22/25, 10:24:26 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: yes sir, there is passing.
[1/22/25, 10:25:05 PM] R Babu: OK. Next Monday we can plan.
[1/22/25, 10:25:21 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir
[1/22/25, 10:26:33 PM] R Babu: Meanwhile can you control the steam valve to pre and D1 to check whether additional steam is passing along with Condensate
[1/22/25, 10:28:56 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: will do sir
[1/22/25, 10:30:53 PM] R Babu: While doing so please watch on evaporator performance and brix also
[1/22/25, 10:47:23 PM] R Babu: Sugar colour is around 950-1000 Iu, whereas moisture is 0.3 to 0.4. Moisture is high for this colour.
[1/22/25, 10:48:28 PM] R Babu: Pressurised hot water temperature is 83 deg.c only. Kindly check the temperature and is there any mixing of processe Condensate directly
[1/22/25, 10:48:57 PM] R Babu: What is the vapour used for BCVP
[1/22/25, 10:49:57 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: will look into this sir
[1/22/25, 10:51:10 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: for now it's vapor 2 sir, boiling is affected when exhaust pressure drops to 14. we already asked cogen to maintain exhaust pressure to atleast 15 psi so that we could shift to vapor 3
[1/22/25, 10:52:35 PM] R Babu: 1st compartment shall be V3 and 2nd compartment shall be V2
[1/22/25, 10:59:14 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir
[1/22/25, 11:00:56 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Cold water pp #2 started at 2250H, load is at 355 A, 50% opening. we will continuously monitor load and increase valve opening
[1/22/25, 11:01:13 PM] R Babu: Last 2 sample C massecuite exhaustion is good.  Vacuum is 133 mbar.  Maintain around 125 mbar which will help further
[1/23/25, 12:35:00 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: 1600H-2400H

[1/23/25, 6:52:05 AM] R Babu: Since bottle type cooling tower is having issue in capacity, let us focus on recycle water so that evaporator hydraulic water can be saved
[1/23/25, 6:53:32 AM] R Babu: what about CVP sweet water line to molasses tank no.4 and whether the pump installed in the position. This is also most important to reduce the weekend pty drop, pH drop and reduce the losses. Please discuss with Sir Russel and complete the work ASAP

[1/24/25, 6:01:50 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: yes it has an alarm sir
[1/24/25, 6:02:20 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir
[1/24/25, 6:02:49 AM] R Babu: Instruct the HG centrifugal operator to watch the basket frequently and if required wash the basket with hot water in empty cycle to clear the bagacillo
[1/24/25, 6:04:02 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: will increase the frequency of cleaning sir
[1/24/25, 6:04:10 AM] R Babu: Instruct the operator who is manually cleaning the clear juice flat screen to clean continuously and inform the issue also. So that he will be watchful
[1/24/25, 6:04:47 AM] R Babu: If it has alarm, why it has not noticed for long time

[1/24/25, 6:07:06 AM] R Babu: What is the feedback of electrical team, why it has tripped.
[1/24/25, 6:08:28 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: The operator knew that the stirrer stopped due to the alarm sir. It would take hours for the stirrer to trip but starting 0500H, the stirrer cannot be reset anymore. That's when I requested for electrical to change the overload relay
[1/24/25, 6:08:59 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: tripping caused by defective overload relay
[1/24/25, 6:14:15 AM] R Babu: 4 HP and what is the overload alarm setting
[1/24/25, 6:14:50 AM] R Babu: At what load it got tripped
[1/24/25, 6:17:07 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: no overload alarm sir, the alarm works when the stirrer stops. At times the stirrer stopped the load does not spike
[1/24/25, 6:18:55 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Load will not increase substantially even if there is resistance in the stirrer itself due to gear reduction
[1/24/25, 6:25:47 AM] Skip Tan: Everyone, use time stamps in your pictures when showing evidence/s.
[1/24/25, 6:26:14 AM] R Babu: What is the set point for tripping alarm
[1/24/25, 6:28:44 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: for our juice clarifier stirrers, there is a sensor installed sir, it will trigger alarm when it detects the stirrer is not rotating anymore.

[1/24/25, 9:05:10 AM] R Babu: Good Karl.
[1/24/25, 9:08:24 AM] Skip Tan: After switching to special raw sugar, we will adjust pan boiling operation by minimizing syrup (preferably zero or no syrup) at C-seed and B-seed. Preferrably, we need high AP C-light for C-seed to aid in pan boiling and reduce boiling time. By doing this, APs are expected to decrease and boiling time will be longer. We are allowed to use additional batch pans for C-seed and B-seed for this case. We will try this, observe the challenges that arise and report immediately with with analysis, corrections and documentation.
[1/24/25, 9:12:39 AM] Skip Tan: This was discussed with Sir @918750599666 for implementation.

[1/25/25, 7:54:19 AM] R Babu: Let us reduce the syrup qty to B grain and C grain. Since we are reducing the syrup to grain instruct the pan boilers to give sufficient time for hardening. Since the sugar produced will be our refinery consumption.  Let us target for 1200-1400 IU colour maximum.
[1/25/25, 7:54:42 AM] R Babu: Reduce to 3,3 and 2,2
[1/25/25, 7:55:51 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: we started implementing this sir. For B developing pans no syrup usage already, for C seed however, we still use syrup but at a minimum

[1/25/25, 8:01:24 AM] R Babu: Then why the condensate level is so low.
[1/25/25, 8:07:23 AM] R Babu: Mill team, please use around 25 % raw water for mill imbibition to improve the condensate position
[1/25/25, 8:08:13 AM] ~ lloyd: Gud morning sir, will do this..
[1/25/25, 8:10:36 AM] R Babu: Process team, even the crushing rate is also high, condensate return to cogen is also around 80 % and the BST tank level is also low. We have to find out the sources of condensate losses as otherwise very difficult to manage.
[1/25/25, 8:16:34 AM] R Babu: CVP C vacuum is less, it is 147 mbar, very high any issue in C.W pump and vacuum pump.
[1/25/25, 8:17:14 AM] R Babu: Maintain good vacuum is most important criteria for better exhaustion, lower molasses pty and lower sugar losses
[1/25/25, 8:27:06 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good morning sir. Cooling Tower is on close loop right now since water level is high. Will revert to Malihao once level subsides
[1/25/25, 8:33:11 AM] R Babu: Kindly look into the condensate consumption points and minimize the condensate usage since the tank levels are low and Cogen DM plant is also under CIP. Please ensure judicious usage of condensate.  Mill team also please use condensate water judiciously.

[1/26/25, 9:47:20 AM] R Babu: Exhaust condensate generation is very good
[1/26/25, 9:48:11 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: When we stopped the two mills earlier sir we also stopped Batt D, soda boiling will finish by 10am
[1/26/25, 9:49:27 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We will monitor for 8-4 shift sir, for any changes in exhaust Condensate Return
[1/26/25, 9:49:53 AM] R Babu: Can we check the condensate seal tank control valve
[1/26/25, 9:52:54 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: After soda boiling sir, we will inspect if we have provision for transfer.
[1/26/25, 9:54:19 AM] R Babu: After from that also is there any possibility of exhaust condensate seepage to V1 or exhaust steam wastage in D pre and D1 to be checked thoroughly
[1/26/25, 10:06:24 AM] R Babu: molasses pty of C4 to C7 machine is high. Kindly check the basket and water washing
[1/26/25, 10:08:01 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: I'm checking it right now sir,
[1/26/25, 10:12:12 AM] R Babu: Mr. Hanzel/ Skip/ Jelyn kindly follow up with Mr. Reese for the C mill stoppage for maintenance since cane inventory is still high.
[1/26/25, 10:14:21 AM] ~ hanzel malayo: Already talked to Reese Sir, with this inventory I suggested to stop C-Mill by around 6pm or if the inventory drops down below 200

%Ex. Cond Return = 89.12

*Correction for TES steam generation for 8am from, it's 166 and not 116 (50tons difference).
[1/26/25, 3:11:19 PM] R Babu: Since crushing stoppage hours will be less for weekly shutdown, let us not liquidate the B & A CVP. Only FS clarifier shall be liquidated and checked since its stirrer breakdown happened in this week.
[1/26/25, 3:19:33 PM] R Babu: Since there is no premium raw and special raw sugar production, let us plan for once in 3 week B-CVP water boiling and 4 week for A- CVP water boiling and record the observation.
[1/26/25, 3:20:29 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted sir
[1/26/25, 3:20:51 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sir, when will we start not producing special raw?
[1/26/25, 3:33:22 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sirs @918750599666 @639339940762. After implementing this set up during 2nd shift yesterday (8-4). The following was observed:
1. Finer but homogeneous grain size of B-massecuite
2. Notable darker color for B-magma (as feedback by A seed pan man).
3. Boiling time for B-seed was longer by 1 hour
4. B and C massecuites are more viscous, already adjusted pan aid (to aid high viscosity)
5. For B massecuite and B molasses purity, we are still observing. 

Note: 
1.Currently on special raw sugar production. Basket setting was 6,6 for BMA and 3,3 for tkii. Latest color at 2pm was 1,202IU
2. Stopped decolorant at a syrup clarifier starting 2nd shift today (addition of decolorant for premium production only). 
FYI.
[1/26/25, 3:34:46 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Syrup AP only ranges from 74-77

[1/26/25, 3:50:36 PM] Skip Tan: If color exceeds 1400IU with premium ACB setting, lets dose decolorizing agent to reduce color. But for now lets keep on monitoring the changes.
[1/26/25, 3:51:23 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted nong @639339940762. For now color is still manageable.

[1/26/25, 5:12:32 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Good afternoon, low sugar production was due to:
1. Resumption of milling from 1st shift stoppage.
2. Increase syrup dosing at C seed graining due to low APs for C light, A molasses (54.57, 56.53)
[1/26/25, 5:41:30 PM] R Babu: As long as sugar colour is 1200- 1400 IU and molasses pty is around 29, let us continue the scheme and observe further. No need to add decolorant.
[1/26/25, 5:42:18 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted sir, we will continue to observe.
[1/26/25, 5:42:33 PM] R Babu: If DSM screen is ready in all aspects, we can even try to stop syrup clarifier and maintain higher surup brix
[1/26/25, 5:47:13 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Good afternoon, 0800-1600

[1/26/25, 9:56:50 PM] R Babu: Mac kindly coordinate and submit the C single cured magma and C double purging magma sugar for analysis. C single cured sugar pty is 60. It is to be checked. C double purging sugar last 3 sample pty is 90 plus. It seems improved. If it is 90 +, C single cured magma should not be 60 pty and for 90+ pty Clt molases pty should be 58-60
[1/26/25, 9:57:26 PM] R Babu: Please kindly check is there any possibility of intermixing of magma or any massecuite mixing

[1/26/25, 11:18:32 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: sir @918750599666, our B-massecuite pty is only 64. B-massecuite as inspected is very sticky already
[1/26/25, 11:19:30 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: we will feed syrup in two cells of CVP-B, and observe more
[1/26/25, 11:21:28 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: I also increased syrup in C graining to achieve 61-64 AP. Three consecutive C strike is only 57-58 AP
[1/26/25, 11:25:37 PM] R Babu: OK. But pty control should be there, let us maintain the pty around 67-68. Do not raise more than this.
[1/26/25, 11:26:39 PM] R Babu: C grain also maintain around 61-62 pty since we are planning to produce 1200-1400 IU sugar only.
[1/26/25, 11:26:43 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, we will further monitor on next analysis results

[1/27/25, 7:59:45 PM] R Babu: Still C - VLJH juice flow is less only around 35 M3/hr.  One time completely close the valve and open so that any choke/ rubber struck in the seating may get released.
[1/27/25, 8:01:43 PM] Skip Tan: They did the same for A Sir.
Previously only C has flow 100m3/H.
[1/27/25, 8:03:30 PM] R Babu: Hope VLJH cleaned during evaporator stopped for cleaning

[1/28/25, 6:30:18 PM] Skip Tan: Noted Sir.
[1/28/25, 6:37:17 PM] R Babu: Good.  Let us observe further.  Once this trial option is OK, we can make the base line water boiling frequency for B and C CVP
[1/28/25, 6:40:12 PM] R Babu: It is most important to make the base line for CVP water boiling to minimise the sugar losses while restarting on Monday start up.
[1/28/25, 6:43:58 PM] R Babu: So far this week start up,  sugar production is on par with projected lkgtc, it is a good sign.  Let us observe further
[1/28/25, 7:17:36 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy. We are adjusting this one sir since our Cmasse is too viscous

[1/28/25, 11:15:30 PM] R Babu: Good.
[1/28/25, 11:15:58 PM] R Babu: Can we run 5 basket
[1/28/25, 11:24:21 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: yes sir, there are times we run 5, but mixer will be emptied, we reduce to 4 or 3 baskets
[1/28/25, 11:30:15 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: CVP-A could not maximize operation sir, due to higher syrup consumption for C seed graining and syrup feeding to CVP-B which we already reduced.
[1/28/25, 11:35:17 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Once B-massecuite purity is normalized to target pty of 67-68, we will stop syrup feed to CVP-B and then also feed a little A-molasses to B developing pans to improve the HG production.

[1/29/25, 10:25:37 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: They diverted pumping final molasses to Molasses Tank #8 without booster pump sir. Upon diversion to MT#7 final scale pp#3&4 found out to have poor delivery
[1/29/25, 10:32:49 AM] R Babu: whether booster pump started now.
[1/29/25, 11:11:48 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: They operated booster pump sir upon finding out it was directed to MT#8. But  upon operating booster pump, still level gets high, so we requested to pump it to MT#7 until level normalise
[1/29/25, 12:28:03 PM] R Babu: Skip kindly discuss with warehouse let them use the molasses tank no. 7 only still the delivery line size to no. 8 change. Already we have tried no. 8 molasses tank and facing pumping issues

2. On -going pump foundation work by Civil target completion by tomorrow, it will undergo 3 days curing then motor and pump set will be install; A and B molasses return line already finished; CVPs individual line on-going installation. 
3. Installed screen at cush-cush conveyor; Unclogged spray nozzles of individual DSM screens; on-going installation of vent and roofing; Changing of DSM screens take off angle to 50degree will follow. As per contractor target completion will be next week.
4. Steam side hydrotesting lines already completed, next will be the juice side (Juice side hydrotesting was schedule every OSR).
5. Dumping system for individual evaporators and main exhaust condensate line already completed. We are now working out for the dumping tank level transmitter (we are checking possible source for level transmitter within the factory).

[1/31/25, 9:43:49 AM] R Babu: Minimum 8000 lkgs to be produced in every shift. Shift incharges concentrate on full swing operation of CVP's, Centrifugal so that sugar will be pushed out
[1/31/25, 9:43:51 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good morning sir. CVP A is already on full swing with 75 - 80 m3/hr syrup flow. 5 HG ACBS in operation

[1/31/25, 9:54:29 AM] R Babu: BST tank levels are low, please divert the V1 condensate to BST. Maintain BST levels 80 % and then divert the V1 condensate to cogen.
[1/31/25, 9:56:26 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Both A and D V1 condensate is going to BST sir. We will monitor condensate levels
[1/31/25, 9:58:22 AM] R Babu: Ohh. Then how come the BST level is low when both A & D V1 condensate is going to BST. Kindly monitor the BST tank level also as otherwise weekend will be problem for refinery to run
[1/31/25, 9:59:49 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Copy sir. Batt D v1 was diverted to BST at 0630H this morning while Batt A v1 was diverted to BST last night at 2330H
[1/31/25, 10:02:02 AM] Daddy Globe: Good morning Sir. AMill juice flowmeter is already operational.

[1/31/25, 4:24:16 PM] R Babu: Cris, why again. It is difficult to pump molasses to MT8 with booster pump for all the C basket running. Kindly request warehouse to reduce the MT7 so that we can pump the molasses to No.7
[1/31/25, 4:28:19 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: There was communication between Sir Skip and Ms Debbie regarding this matter sir. As per Ms Debbie, MT7 level is high.  Will request warehouse to  free up MT7 so that we can resume pumping there
[1/31/25, 4:30:44 PM] R Babu: Jelyn please discuss Sir Russel and make the 10 inches line to MT8 as early as possible
[1/31/25, 4:33:22 PM] R Babu: Day before yesterday also, there was a problem to pump the molasses to tank no.8 and machines were restricted. I do not want to happen again since our house stock is very high any hampering in the centrifugal operation will leads to further increase in stock and leads to sugar losses.
[1/31/25, 4:34:07 PM] R Babu: Please carefully monitor and coordinate with warehouse, once MT7 level is low, transfer again to MT7
[1/31/25, 4:34:42 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted sir,
[1/31/25, 4:45:07 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: I also share the same concern sir that's why i already refused diversion to MT8 earlier today. However Ms Debbie called and informed that tank 7 level is critical. We will monitor sir and request immediate diversion to MT7

[2/1/25, 9:34:21 AM] R Babu: Good morning. House stock is not reducing. Today morning also stock is 34750 lkgs, which is very high. Let us push and produce sugar which is equivalent to lkgtc. Building up the stock leads to sugar losses. Hence shift incharges please focus on sugar production and maximise all CVP operation and centrifugal operation.
[2/1/25, 9:34:43 AM] R Babu: CVC -C vacuum is low. Any issue in injection water pressure.
[2/1/25, 9:35:03 AM] R Babu: what is the CVC-crystalliser outlet temperature

[2/1/25, 10:07:44 AM] R Babu: 1st shift crushing is 4972 Tons and sugar produced is 7283 lkgs which is equivalent to 1.47 lkgtc. Our actual lkgtc is 1.59. Last 2 days every shift and day, the sugar production is lesser than projected lkgtc resulting huge pile up of sugar stock in a tune of nearly 35 K lkgs. 35K stock is very high and alarming, keeping high stock leads to conversion of sugar into molasses and will end up with sugar losses. Please focus on pan boiling and centrifugation to maximise the sugar production.

[2/1/25, 2:29:35 PM] R Babu: Cris, still sugar production is less. Each shift sugar production should be 8000 lkgs minimum to match the lkgtc. We have increased the steam flow and exhaust steam pressure to push the pan boiling to facilitate to liquidate house stock and produce higher quantity sugar
[2/1/25, 2:29:53 PM] Skip Tan: Its fast Sir.
Its just that the video captured only looks slow.

[2/1/25, 3:06:56 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sir @639284029256 can we use the line with the existing flowmeter?
[2/1/25, 3:07:34 PM] R Babu: Is there any issue in CVP -A boiling. There is no plan for water boiling.  If there is any problem or sluggish boiling, we can plan after mutual discussion
[2/1/25, 3:08:11 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi jarj, for clarification the installation was not wrong, C mill has two existing discharge lines, we could transfer flow to the line with the existing flowmeter. FYI
[2/1/25, 3:08:16 PM] ~ hanzel malayo: Yes we will switch the juice flow of C-Mill to the  pipeline with flowmeter

[2/1/25, 3:16:32 PM] R Babu: Inspite of A & D V1 condensate to BST, tank level is not building up. Please kindly check any condensate leaks. Please judiciously use the condensate.
[2/1/25, 3:17:41 PM] R Babu: Mill team, please use around 25 % raw water to mill imbibition to build up the BST tank level. Thanks
[2/1/25, 3:57:50 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Boiling is sluggish sir. Steam supply has to be increased to 900 mbar in order to increase syrup flow. This is not normal. Normally at 750 - 800 mbar steam supply, syrup feeding is at 80m3/hr already especially if syrup brix is high.

This might suggest that heating is already inefficient and calandria might need water boiling.
[2/1/25, 4:09:34 PM] R Babu: Kindly discuss with Mr. Murugesan and let him also check the CVP A boiling and  then we will take a decision.

[2/2/25, 9:36:20 AM] R Babu: Process team, balance the crushing rate according to cleaning schedule of D battery and push the juice to the pan floor and maximise the CVP-A and sugar production.
[2/2/25, 9:40:15 AM] R Babu: Today morning also stock is nearly 35 K. We have to find the way to keep the stock around 31-32 K so that our production will match the lkgtc. Keeping the stock always high is not a good practice.
[2/2/25, 9:58:59 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. We are doing adjustments to maximize sugar production. We will push syrup at 59-60 bx
‎[2/2/25, 10:10:47 AM] R Babu: ‎image omitted

[2/2/25, 10:12:34 AM] R Babu: Regulate the crushing rate 13-13.5 K to suite for evaporator working and soda boiling of D battery.
[2/2/25, 10:14:10 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Earlier, no syrup available at panfloor sir that's why i instructed to push syrup at lower bx
[2/2/25, 10:14:49 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Already communicated with mills SIC to adjust milling rate for Batt ABC operations
[2/2/25, 10:17:59 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: This is Noted Sir.
[2/2/25, 10:29:53 AM] Skip Tan: Sir, most of are stocks are in the equipment operating and seed/magma tanks.
Should we stop 1 section of CVP-B to reduce the stock? Compared to previous set-up, this is the only additional equipement we operated.
For the variable stock, we also keep our syrup tank and HG mixer levels  low.
[2/2/25, 10:33:06 AM] R Babu: Do not stop the 2nd compartment.  Today morning also syrup tanks were empty whereas mixed juice and clear juice tanks are high level. This should not happen.
[2/2/25, 10:34:25 AM] R Babu: Our sugar production has to match the lkgtc. It is not matching for last 3 days  and that is the worrying factor.
[2/2/25, 10:36:16 AM] Skip Tan: Noted Sir.

MJ & CJ may seem high but contribution in stock is less.
But we lower these by not putting additional stock to CJ DSM tank while coordinating with mills team.
[2/2/25, 10:37:44 AM] R Babu: It is not the stock, it will slow down the CVP A throughout .
[2/2/25, 10:38:34 AM] Skip Tan: Noted Sir.

We also adjusted parts of pan boiling to maximize syrup for CVP-A. We dosed additional pan aid at b-boiling to reduce viscosity. We will keep ACBs maximized to keep producing sugar.
[2/2/25, 10:38:39 AM] R Babu: Kindly discuss with Mr.Murugesan for CVP-A liquidation and water boiling
[2/2/25, 10:39:45 AM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
This is also why, we reduced the syrup brix of evaps to keep the syrup flowing to CVP-A.
[2/2/25, 10:39:58 AM] Skip Tan: Will do Sir.
[2/2/25, 10:40:43 AM] R Babu: Yes we can reduce the syrup brix to operate CVP-A on continuously
[2/2/25, 11:01:52 AM] Skip Tan: As discussed with Sir @918056290588, we will push CJ through the evaporators by gradually lowering Brix output (lowest limit at 50°Bx) as long as syrup clarifier is not affected to avoid starving of CVP-A. Since light syrup would be better than condensate to feed at CVP-A. Also, we will be adjusting pan aid at B-boiling.
For CVP water boiling, we will do 1 section tonight or tomorrow while the other section will be scheduled next week. But same with previous set-up, we will immediately replenish the seed in CVP. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/2/25, 12:19:22 PM] R Babu: Mill/ Process Team: Today cane projection is 14 K as per Mr. Reese, hence continue to run two mills till cane exhausted. Monday start up again at 6 PM with A mill and C mill on Tuesday around 2 PM. Since Cogen is also planning to stop for maintenance about 8-10 hrs, hope cane will be exhausted around 2 AM, boiling house liquidation and A battery chemical boiling will be completed by 8 am to 9 am. So that cogen maintenance will be complete by 5-6 PM.

1. B- grain is more viscosity observed so, we use viscosity reducer 5kg for each B- grain pans 30 minutes before dropping 
2. ⁠B CVP 1st and 2nd compartment feed condensate water only. From 3rd compartment start A- molasses feeding, this one improve the massecuite quality 
3. ⁠C- grain pan also continue the viscosity reducer addition to 15 kg before 30 minutes to drop 
4. ⁠C- CVP 1st and 2nd compartment feed only condensate water only, from 3rd compartment start to B- molasses feeding 
Please monitor closely

[2/3/25, 11:31:47 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted sir,
[2/3/25, 11:57:26 AM] R Babu: Skip/ Jelyn during start up, while cut in the evaporator battery, do not circulate the juice for long time in the evaporator itself to maintain the brix, even the brix is less around 45-50 also pump it to pan floor. Since it is start up, it can be managed in the pan.  Keeping the juice in the evaporator long time leads to purity drop.  Hence this time while cut in evaporator follow this method to pump the low brix to pan floor and we will observe the pty drop in evaporator.
[2/3/25, 12:02:05 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sir, we already doing this as per your instruction last December.

[2/4/25, 2:14:45 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: As per mills sir, if two mills running maceration from tank #3 is not enough.

[2/4/25, 2:16:21 PM] ~ hanzel malayo: Good afternoon Sir, pump capacity in BST is not enough for 2 mills since it's only arou 600 to 800gpm. Our requirement for 2 mills is around 1300 gpm
[2/4/25, 2:19:25 PM] R Babu: Good afternoon. Pump capacity should be suitable for complete maceration from BST tanks. Please kindly plan accordingly.
[2/4/25, 2:28:27 PM] ~ hanzel malayo: Noted Sir, in that case we will need to install a bigger pump and rectify the existing pipings from BST to our Imbibition Tanks. Another option which will be faster to implement is to install a pipeline in the new 12" dia line of combined condensate and connect it with our existing Imbibition pipes.
[2/4/25, 2:33:59 PM] R Babu: 12 " pipe line from process condensate  to BST tank and from BST to process i think line size is small. Jelyn can confirm the size.

[2/4/25, 4:27:32 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: All Amol feeding to CVP-B sir. For C graining, 15% syrup for footing while for B graining little syrup (1 sight glass) was utilized
[2/4/25, 4:35:01 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sir as per computation by raw house team, if pipeline form BST #3 to mills maceration was 6'diameter we need to replace the current pump set (30hP, 600GPM) to 1500GPM, 125hP. But as per sir Hanzel, current pipeline was 4"diameter only. A and C mills requires at least 1400GPM for maceration. For me sir, it is much economical to relocate the current pipeline (the one that directly tap at raw house) than we replace the pump set and it will be much faster since the current and the new line is just beside each other.

[2/4/25, 9:53:52 PM] R Babu: 4pm to 8 PM sugar production is 3160 lkgs. Continue to push the syrup into pan in such a way to operate the CVP-A continuously and maximise the HG centrifugal operation.
[2/4/25, 9:57:16 PM] R Babu: B molasses stock is high, is there any issue in CVP-C boiling
[2/4/25, 10:04:10 PM] R Babu: CVC cooling crystallizer massecuite outlet temperature shown 60 deg.C and calorifier outlet temperature 64 dg.C. Kindly check
[2/4/25, 10:05:59 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Five HG ACBs are currently operating and CVP-A is on full swing sir. We also target only 55 syrup brix for Batt B and only 60 for battery A and D to push production
[2/4/25, 10:07:00 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We already adjusted CVP-C sir since the start of shift to decrease the B molasses stock
[2/4/25, 10:07:56 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We do cooling for CVCs sir and decreased the calorifier setpoint, it is gradually decreasing
[2/4/25, 10:10:38 PM] R Babu: Molasses pty is high. Kindly check the massecuite quality and wash water in centrifugals.
[2/4/25, 10:17:00 PM] R Babu: Yes, We should not keep the juice load in mixed juice and clear juice tank and CVP-A is waiting for syrup. Hence 55 brix is also OK as along as there is no issue in syrup clarifier. Loose syrup is better than feeding condensate water as moment water for the CVP-A.
[2/4/25, 10:17:24 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, we will adjust
[2/4/25, 10:19:30 PM] R Babu: Mac, Kindly communicate  the night shift Incharge also to maintain lower syrup brix to maintain the CVP-throughput.
[2/4/25, 10:21:13 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir. We will further decrease syrup brix depending on the syrup level/mixer level as to maximize CVP-A and HG throughput
[2/4/25, 10:22:02 PM] R Babu: Yes, Kindly communicate night shift SIC also
[2/4/25, 10:25:25 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: I am the night shift SIC sir, until 8 AM.

[2/5/25, 6:50:38 PM] R Babu: Process team SIC sugar production has to match the projected lkgtc with respect to crushing. 2nd shift production is low as compared with crushing. Kindly concentrate more on maximise the CVP-A throughput and sugar production. A molasses and B molasses load is high.
[2/5/25, 6:55:12 PM] R Babu: Now all C basket is running , kindly push the B & C massecuite curing also.
[2/5/25, 7:01:04 PM] R Babu: It is good that syrup brix reduced to 55- 57 to maintain continuous feed to the CVP-A so that production shall be maximised. Maximise the B & C curing so that sufficient seed will be available and which will improve the A & B massecuite purity.
[2/5/25, 7:02:46 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. We consume more syrup for Bseed and Cseed due to low purity of Amol and Clight molasses.

[2/5/25, 7:43:51 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: We will first observe the operation of FSM#3 and will advise molasses tender to directly pump to MT#9 alone with booster pump
[2/5/25, 7:46:44 PM] R Babu: At present B mol and A mol load is high. Kindly pump the molasses to MT7 and MT9. Do not try now to MT9  alone. Let us reduce the molasses load and try later in the day time so that any issue will be attended immediately.

[2/6/25, 9:28:04 AM] R Babu: Good morning Cris. All juice tanks are full and syrup tanks are empty. Due to sudden tripping and restart juice levels are high. Now we have to maximise the sugar production, kindly reduce the syrup brix and push the syrup to pan so that CVP-A will operate continuously with maximum syrup feed which will maximise HG centrifugal and sugar production.

[2/6/25, 9:30:16 AM] R Babu: A molasses load is also high, is there any issue, all CVP operation to be maximised and all centrifugal operation to be maximised, since our lkgtc is in improving trend.
[2/6/25, 9:31:43 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: High A-mol level was due to the low steam pressure earlier sir. The current level is already declining compared to earlier. Will push more to reduce levels.

[2/7/25, 12:48:54 AM] R Babu: 3rd shift sugar production is good. Overall sugar production is matching and better than lkgtc. Good sign let us always maintain the sugar production matching the projected lkgtc with cane crushed, so that house stock will be less and the losses will be in control. Keep it up process team
[2/7/25, 12:49:51 AM] R Babu: Steam due Raw:
- 2,488tons
Return Condensate:
- 2,243tons
Percent Return Condensate: 
- 90.15%
[2/7/25, 12:50:48 AM] R Babu: Good to see that Condensate return improved to 90+ even with D battery is in service. Let us monitor the D battery operation.
[2/7/25, 12:57:25 AM] R Babu: A mol and B mol stock is increasing. Focus on CVP -B& CVP -C boiling. Still CVP-C vacuum is low.
[2/7/25, 1:00:54 AM] R Babu: 3rd shift steam % cane 52.17 %, which is very high. Is there any reason apart from operating lower syrup brix.   Hope mixed juice final heating with V1 and CVP with 3rd and 2nd vapour.
[2/7/25, 1:03:50 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, CVP-B and C already on full swing. As for the vacuum of CVP-C, the major reason is the high hydraulic load of our evaporators sir due to the low syrup brix. We are now adjusting all our condenser openings so that we will have sufficient injection pressure.
[2/7/25, 1:05:28 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: CVP-B both sections is on V2 right now sir. We will shift one section to V3 once we see exhaust is maintained to 15 psig, since A-mol level is high we need to ensure that boiling is good continuously.
[2/7/25, 1:05:52 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: our last juice heating is on V1
[2/7/25, 1:13:20 AM] R Babu: OK. Adjust condenser  cold water  accordingly to maintain vacuum
[2/7/25, 1:14:43 AM] R Babu: OK. Based on 3rd vapour pressure and temperature 1st compartment shall be in 3rd vapour.
[2/7/25, 1:16:17 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We will add another injection water pump sir to compensate for the low injection pressure. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/7/25, 10:12:54 AM] R Babu: Good morning. Raw sugar colour is 2000 IU, why there is a colour increase. Mr. Murugesan please concentrate on raw house and analyse the reasons for higher sugar colour. Without increasing the losses, how to manage the sugar colour to 1200-1300 IU.  If required we can increase the wash water in the centrifugal.
[2/7/25, 10:15:19 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good morning sir. Color increase is due to the poor quality of B-magma as reported by Marc earlier sir. Sir Murugesan is currently helping us do adjustments to improve B-magma, A seed and raw sugar ‎<This message was edited>
[2/7/25, 10:18:03 AM] R Babu: Kindly post the present picture of B magma
[2/7/25, 10:19:21 AM] R Babu: Improve the B magma pty to 90+

[2/7/25, 10:26:31 AM] ~ Murugesan: Already increased the raw sugar wash time 3, 3 to 5, 5 seconds 
And increase the B massecuite spry water in the B- basket also
[2/7/25, 10:27:12 AM] R Babu: Skip/ Jelyn and process team, Steam consumption is continuously high. One of the reason is lower syrup brix ,we are pushing to pan floor to maintain the sugar production.  Hence next week let us operate 4 evaporator on wednesday to saturday to improve the brix. Kindly plan the evaporator cleaning cycle accordingly. This will help us to improve the brix and reduce the steam consumption at pan and subsequently reduces the steam.
[2/7/25, 10:28:01 AM] R Babu: Yes, it seems improved. What is the pty
[2/7/25, 10:28:54 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: If we operate 4 evaporators, will it be all exhaust? Or one small evaporator will be vapor 1. Also what would be our MJ%Cane? 105 or 110?
[2/7/25, 10:29:27 AM] R Babu: All exhaust and juice % cane 105 only
[2/7/25, 10:30:51 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted sir

[2/7/25, 1:34:50 PM] R Babu: Sugar production is less continuously. How many HG centrifugal machines are running
[2/7/25, 1:35:53 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Currently sir 5 centrifugals running. We've increased wash time and spin cycle to improve color
[2/7/25, 1:36:47 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Syrup also being pushed to the panfloor.  At 58 to 59 bx. However we are currently consuming syrup for B-CVP and C seed graining. We will adjust feeding if purities continuously improve
[2/7/25, 1:38:00 PM] R Babu: B-massecuite last sample pty is 69.50.
[2/7/25, 1:42:39 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: We will gradually decrease syrup feeding to CVP B if AP stays consistent. For now i will reduce it from 2 to 1 cell

[2/7/25, 4:27:21 PM] R Babu: 8 AM to 4 PM sugar production is less . it is only 6694 lkgs. Why
[2/7/25, 4:30:04 PM] R Babu: Syrup tank level is 51 %, why level is high here and no level in pan floor syrup tank
[2/7/25, 4:33:24 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good afternoon sir. Lower production in second shift due to:

1. Syrup utilization at CVP - B and C seed graining due to low B-masse AP earlier and low C-light molasses purity
2. Low load of HG ACBs to maintain sugar color below 2000 IU
3. Longer wash time and cycle time of ACBs
[2/7/25, 4:33:43 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Pan floor syrup level is at 52.5% sir. CVP-A is already on full swing
[2/7/25, 4:34:19 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: 7 HG ACBs also in operation
‎[2/7/25, 5:27:55 PM] R Babu: ‎image omitted
[2/7/25, 5:29:00 PM] R Babu: Crushing is 5013 tonnes whereas sugar production is 6694 only. Lkgtc is very less.
[2/7/25, 5:31:40 PM] R Babu: Sugar production has to increased in 3rd shift to  make up the lesser production in 2nd shift
[2/7/25, 5:38:47 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Copy sir
[2/7/25, 5:55:13 PM] R Babu: House stock increased from 31673 lkgs to 33060 lkgs. There is a raise in sugar stock of 1387 lkgs. As discussed in the morning meeting let us keep the target to maintain 31 k to 32 k House stock.  Maximum should be 32 K. Let us try to operate at 31k.
[2/7/25, 5:56:22 PM] R Babu: Keeping higher house stock leads to sugar losses.  Hence please make up the sugar production in 3rd shift.

[2/7/25, 7:54:07 PM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: This is noted. We will reduce our milling rate Sir.
[2/7/25, 7:57:43 PM] ~ hanzel malayo: Good Evening Sir, we have already reduced the speed of 2 mills at below it's normal rated speed since yesterday and we did not adjust it since then coz 3rd shift of yesterday and 1st shift of today is only around 4,800 Tons, but for some time A-Mill is still getting higher tch, it could be the result of no disruptions due stones and muddy canes. Another possibility for higher tch could be lower fiber is coming in the mill. C-Mill is only averaging around 180 to 190 tch. Anyway we will reduce more our mill speeds in A-Mill 🙏

[2/7/25, 9:38:39 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Good evening sir, at the start of 8pm shift, 8 ACBs were running. I'll check the 9pm production. Now, 5 ACBs are running on 5,5 washing for BMA and 4,4 for TK
[2/7/25, 9:40:24 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: We will continue to push syrups to panfloor at 55-57 bx sir since we use more syrup at Cseed graining due to low purity of clight (<50). We will cope up with the production, sir
[2/7/25, 9:41:13 PM] R Babu: What is the raw sugar colour.

[2/8/25, 8:52:33 AM] R Babu: Good morning. B-massecuite pty and B molasses pty is very low. It will leads to higher non sugar recirculation and leads to losses, hence improve the B-M/C pty and B molasses pty.  Keep higher wash in B centrifugal. What is the Clt pty in the 1st shift so far no analysis. C magma pty to be increased to improve the B-M/C pty. Maintain higher wash in C double purging basket also to improve the C magma pty and Clt molasses pty.
[2/8/25, 8:52:54 AM] R Babu: What is the wash water timing in HG centrifugal.
[2/8/25, 8:55:32 AM] R Babu: House stock is almost 34K at 12 MN, we should aim to keep 32 K maximum which will facilitate tom minimise the sugar losses. SIC please kindly focus on this.
[2/8/25, 8:58:04 AM] R Babu: 1st shift sugar production is  9143 lkgs. Really good production, keep it up.  With this production house stock would have reduced, hence maintain maximum operation of centrifugal with good purging in  C & B massecuite.
[2/8/25, 8:59:57 AM] R Babu: B-centrifugal basket cleaning shall be taken one by one to facilitate the molasses drainage hole cleaning. Hope only 3 machines are running. Hence one by one cleaning to be taken on top  most priority.
[2/8/25, 9:00:51 AM] R Babu: CFW magma consistency shall be little bit loose to facilitate better purging in C double curing basket to improve C sugar quality
[2/8/25, 9:05:00 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted on all of these sir. no analysis sir due to stoppage of double purge, it resumed already 7 am sir.
[2/8/25, 9:05:46 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: we continuously feed 2 cells of syrup to CVP-B to improve the purity and will increase washing in A and B baskets to improve molasses purities
[2/8/25, 9:10:04 AM] ~ Murugesan: Good morning 
All molasses purity is very low 
So I suggested to increase the basket water for all stages to boost the molasses purity
[2/8/25, 9:12:17 AM] R Babu: why double purging stopped
[2/8/25, 9:23:49 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: c lte mol tank is full sir. Now, we will utilize again c light for c grain
[2/8/25, 9:24:18 AM] R Babu: Yes, non sugar recirculation to be imcreased
[2/8/25, 9:24:45 AM] ~ Murugesan: Ok top up to c grain
[2/8/25, 9:26:13 AM] R Babu: Yes, how can tank full and stopped C double purging, if the pty is less, C-grain media with A-hy + Syrup and fill with A-ht and Clt molasses
[2/8/25, 9:26:37 AM] R Babu: Yes
[2/8/25, 9:29:33 AM] R Babu: Mr. Murugesan please concentrate on both raw and refinery, in refinery also yesterday reject syrup qty is very high which is almost 11 % on solids which is very high.

[2/13/25, 7:55:12 AM] R Babu: Do not allow to stagnate the water in sump pit, every shift sump pit to be emptied. Today we are planning to remove the sludge from sump pit. Once sludge removed wash the tank thoroughly with water and apply around 2 kg of bleaching powder.
[2/13/25, 7:56:15 AM] R Babu: kindly add 1kg of bleaching powder every shift in sump pit till further advice
[2/13/25, 8:51:16 AM] R Babu: Juice tank levels are very high. Last one hour level builds up considerably. Whether crushing rate is high
[2/13/25, 8:52:19 AM] R Babu: Or any issues in heater
[2/13/25, 8:56:21 AM] Skip Tan: Currently, lowering the evaporator Brix.

[2/13/25, 9:19:02 AM] R Babu: Last 2 hours crushing is high, average 645 TPH which is equivalent to 15468 TPD, this may be reason for higher juice level is juice tank. Mill team please maintain steady crushing rate, which will be better for the juice clarification and in turn to entire process. Please maintain steady crushing rate.
[2/13/25, 9:19:50 AM] R Babu: Do not see the shift crushing rate, each and every hour crushing rate is very important.

[2/13/25, 9:32:47 AM] R Babu: Why always HG centrifugal No. 1 to 5 is running in early 1st shift. It should be balanced. If the BMA and TK machine is not sufficient for raw massecuite production, let us run continuously.  If we run only in 1st shift during start up sugar quality will be bad and some uncured material will flow along with sugar

[2/15/25, 6:52:51 AM] R Babu: Good morning Karl. Juice tank level is building up.  Pan floor syrup tank is also 40%. But CVP A feed is 65 -70 m3/hr. Is there any issue in CVPA
[2/15/25, 7:00:36 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: This is due to liquidation of battery C, sir for stoppage.
[2/15/25, 7:02:00 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: CVP-A is on maximum feeding at 15 cells already sir. Syrup bx is quite low due to start up of Battery and liquidation of C. Level is now gradually decreasing sir
[2/15/25, 7:03:14 AM] R Babu: OK. 1st shift sugar production is very less. Sugar production should match crushing and lkgtc
[2/15/25, 7:05:47 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. We will cope up in the succeeding hours to match the production and crushing

[2/15/25, 7:43:57 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. We will adjust from 880 to 900  mbar sir
[2/15/25, 9:39:22 AM] R Babu: Limed juice pH is so low, last hour it is 7.0 only. Actually we have planned to increase to 8.0-8.1 this week to increase the raw syrup pH and cooling tower pH to facilitate the WWTP influent pH better.  Please kindly check and improve the pH.  7.0 pH will leads to inversion in the evaporator. Please increase the PH immediately

[2/20/25, 2:31:47 PM] ~ Murugesan: Good evening 
Any work update for Nash vacuum pump for B-CVP?
[2/20/25, 2:37:03 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good afternoon sir. Maintenance will do servicing right now. After that we will try it again
[2/20/25, 2:38:01 PM] ~ Murugesan: Thank you

[2/20/25, 4:20:20 PM] R Babu: A molasses load is continuously on higher side. Is there any issues in CVP B boiling.  Whether B CVP is operating at maximum throughput. Mr. Murugesan kindly check.
‎[2/20/25, 4:20:47 PM] ~ Ronalee: ‎image omitted
[2/20/25, 4:20:52 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: CVP-B is on maximum sir with 12 cells feeding Amol
[2/20/25, 4:44:33 PM] ~ Murugesan: Already feeding adjusted sir

[2/20/25, 7:27:08 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Resumed feeding 1 cell syrup to CVP B due to low Bmasse AP ‎<This message was edited>
[2/20/25, 8:49:51 PM] R Babu: whether the HG centrifugal water wash reduced, what is the present water washing.  Within short span of time, A molasses level reduced considerably.
[2/20/25, 8:51:38 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Good evening sir. Current wash time is 6,8 for BMA, for TK it's 4,6
[2/20/25, 8:53:44 PM] R Babu: Good evening. Sugar colour is also around 1200 IU, let us maintain 1000 IU and less.  B magma pty should be 90+.
[2/20/25, 8:54:45 PM] R Babu: Frequently B massecuite,  B molasses and B magma pty is fluctuating. Maintain sufficient wash water at B centrifugal to maintain B magma pty 90+
[2/20/25, 8:55:32 PM] R Babu: Do not reduce the HG centrifugal water washing timing due to A molasses load
[2/20/25, 8:57:20 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, already made adjustments on B centrifugals wash

[2/20/25, 9:17:15 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Shifted to special raw sugar production at 2115H
[2/20/25, 9:20:48 PM] R Babu: Why to special raw
[2/20/25, 9:20:52 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Reduced load to HG ACB #1-#5. Will have to divert portion of massecuite flow to A1 to A5 if mixer level continues to increase.
[2/20/25, 9:23:10 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Premium raw color should be below 1100 IU sir. We will adjust basket loading and revert to premium production once sugar color and quality improves
[2/20/25, 9:24:36 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: 8pm raw sugar analysis is already 1221 IU and moisture is high at 0.88
[2/20/25, 9:25:11 PM] R Babu: OK. Reduce the massecuite load to centrifugal.
[2/20/25, 9:26:04 PM] R Babu: What is the spinning time
[2/20/25, 9:26:45 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, we already reduced load. spinning time is at 28 sec.
[2/20/25, 9:32:33 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Poor sugar quality could be attributed to low B-massecuite purity and ultimately low B-magma purity. This will improve with time sir as A-mol level is at manageable level and A-mol feed to CVP-B was already reduced. We will continue to feed 1 cell of CVP-B with syrup and monitor B-magma quality.
[2/20/25, 9:32:59 PM] R Babu: BMA morning raised to 30 second and TK 28 Sec
[2/20/25, 9:33:19 PM] R Babu: Increase the spinning 2 sec each
[2/20/25, 9:33:31 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir

[2/21/25, 2:07:35 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Inconsistent sugar color is due to non-uniform size of sugar grains. This may be due to on and off operation of double purging,which causes variation in B-grain size. Advised B pan man to thoroughly wash B-magma as to minimize grain size disparity.

[2/21/25, 5:23:35 AM] R Babu: Good morning.  Congratulations to the entire team for the good crushing and very good sugar production.  Keep it up.
[2/21/25, 5:46:42 AM] R Babu: why double purging is on and off. Is it Clt molasses full. Clt molasses pty is 47 and C double purging magma pty is not reported. C single purging magma pty is 62 only.
[2/21/25, 5:47:14 AM] R Babu: In the 1st shift raw sugar colour not recorded so far, what is the colour
[2/21/25, 5:50:46 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Clt tank is always full because A-molasses was used in C graining to decrease A-molasses levels sir. Even now that we feed A-molasses and C-lt in a 50-50 ratio there will come a time that clt tank will be full
[2/21/25, 5:53:21 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: double purging was stopped at 0140H sir and resumed 0500H.
[2/21/25, 5:54:38 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: It is 1240 IU at 0400H sir. We already sent a sample to QA for analysis so that we could shift to premium if it's below 1100 IU
[2/21/25, 6:02:53 AM] R Babu: To reduce the load of A molasses to consume in C graining is not a right practise it should be based on pty control, even if you consume in graining also, balance should be consumed in CVP-B . Unless otherwise so much of dissolution happens in HG centrifugal and poor crystal % massecuite may leads to higher A molasses. Mr. Murugesan  kindly look into it.
[2/21/25, 6:03:57 AM] R Babu: Mac, 1st shift sugar production is less, upto 4 AM 3583 only, very low against the lkgtc.  How many machines are running.
[2/21/25, 6:08:41 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: 8 machines currently running sir
[2/21/25, 6:08:42 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir
[2/21/25, 6:29:23 AM] R Babu: Try to operate 7 machines, so that we can continuously run for 7 machine. Sometimes 8 machine and sometime 5 machine affects the operation.
[2/21/25, 6:35:43 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: For 8 machines running sir, the other 5 machine's mixer level is unaffected
[2/21/25, 6:45:51 AM] ~ Murugesan: Good morning 
I’ll check this one sir
[2/21/25, 6:53:22 AM] ~ Murugesan: Good morning Mr Marc 
C-lit purity is very low so start feed one compartment (#2) C-lite molasses for C-CVP to reduce the tank level and low purity material 
Maintain the C-grain purity 
and continue to C -double purging
Thank you ‎<This message was edited>
[2/21/25, 6:54:20 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, will do
[2/21/25, 7:01:47 AM] ~ Murugesan: Kindly increase the A - massecuite crystal size to reduce the grain flow if grain size is small and  check the A- grain preparation and magma cleaning also
[2/21/25, 7:05:04 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, we will adjust accordingly
[2/21/25, 7:26:36 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: shifted to premium raw sugar production at 0710H
[2/21/25, 7:30:34 AM] R Babu: Good. What is the colour

[2/21/25, 7:55:59 AM] R Babu: Mixed juice heater temperature is 101.7 degrees only. Kindly maintain the temperature . Since sugar is premkum raw sugar reduction in temperature increases teh sediments level
[2/21/25, 7:58:19 AM] ~ Nelson Delfin: Already made adjustments Sir.
[2/21/25, 9:13:35 AM] R Babu: What is the status of BMA No.2 pan, whether discharge valve positioned.
[2/21/25, 9:14:55 AM] R Babu: milling rate from 12mn-4am is highly fluctuating. is it reporting error? or sleepy mill supervisor?
[2/21/25, 9:19:05 AM] R Babu: Above is the message from Sir Alvin.  Mill and Process team please regularly monitor the crushing rate, erratic crushing rate will disturb the entire process. Yesterday 2nd shift also same crushing rate is high. Please take and this should not happen again.
[2/21/25, 9:21:49 AM] ~ lloyd: Yes Sir..
[2/21/25, 9:25:37 AM] ~ hanzel malayo: Good Morning Sir, it could be a reporting error and it's just a matter of timing of scanning of trip tickets in Cane Quality Inspection when cane is unloaded in the cane carriers since our milling is continuous with no major stoppages
[2/21/25, 10:11:51 AM] Daddy Globe: @639284029256 please endeavor the team to  scan trip tickets within the same hour of milling. in order to avoid confusion. trip ticket scanner is too busy on 12mn-4am shift? ‎<This message was edited>
[2/21/25, 10:17:37 AM] ~ hanzel malayo: Noted Sir, will talk to qa/qc team on how to resolve the issue🙏
[2/21/25, 10:26:07 AM] R Babu: Skip / Jelyn please discuss with Sir John Roel and replace the BMA machine wash water Nozzle similar to TK machine.  Washing is not at all effective in BMA. Basket bottom layer it is partially un cured resulting higher sugar colour.  Even with less loading and higher water wash, sugar colour is not good.  Please discuss with Sir John and do it as early as possible
[2/21/25, 10:29:03 AM] R Babu: Jelyn once magma diversion line to refinery melter is completed, kindly divert portion of syrup clarifier outlet line to melter. This is required to try premium raw for nestle at refinery once refinery is stopped.
[2/21/25, 10:30:06 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted sir,
[2/21/25, 10:30:29 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: I'll check the progress sir.
[2/21/25, 10:32:06 AM] R Babu: Refinery reject one additional line to be extended to A molasses.  This is required once premium raw sugar production starts here and refinery reject will be utilised in B boiling depending upon the purity. Please coordinate this work with refinery
[2/21/25, 10:33:12 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sir @918750599666 can we meet with refinery team as to be clear where will be the discharge of the remelt.
[2/21/25, 10:33:31 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted on this sir,
[2/21/25, 10:35:49 AM] R Babu: OK from raw house B and C magma line to refinery melter.
[2/21/25, 10:36:05 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Ok sir,
[2/21/25, 11:08:11 AM] Skip Tan: @639091795139 , please update Sir Russel's team of this.
Originally, remelt B&C magma was going to affinition melt screen. Now it will go to affination melter along with clarified syrup (previously not estimated).
[2/21/25, 11:09:18 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: already talked to them nong, for the clarified syrup I am not aware of this line

Syrup flow is maxed out at 60 m³/hr with steam supply pressure at 900 mbar, 15 cell on syrup feed. For now we increased the opening of jigger to improve massecuite boiling.
‎[2/22/25, 5:39:47 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: ‎video omitted

Ok kindly increase the vacuum 140mbar
[2/22/25, 6:25:56 AM] R Babu: Good morning.  It is due to low brix or due for cleaning.  What is the reason.
[2/22/25, 6:27:03 AM] R Babu: Mixed juice temperature is 98.7 degrees,  exhaust pressure is also 12 psig, but steam flow is 292 tph.
[2/22/25, 6:27:18 AM] R Babu: Maintain the juice temperature as otherwise it will disturb the clarifier
[2/22/25, 6:31:14 AM] R Babu: Why it is shifted and what is the raw sugar colour.
[2/22/25, 6:34:47 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir , vacuum already adjusted to 140mbar and decreased seed pump speed to improve grain size
[2/22/25, 6:35:40 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: This is due to soda boiling of Battery B sir.
[2/22/25, 6:35:53 AM] ~ Murugesan: Good
[2/22/25, 6:37:33 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Due to high color and moisture sir. sugar size is finer due to poor boiling of CVP-A. We already made adjustments so that boiling would improve.

Color: 1317
Moisture: 0.50
Sediment: 77 ppm
[2/22/25, 6:46:42 AM] R Babu: A massecuite pty is 80+ then why there is a poor boiling and grain size is finer. Reason to be analysed properly. Whether CVP A is due for water boiling.  Kindly check.
[2/22/25, 6:47:21 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: yes sir, CVP A needs water boiling during MSDR
[2/22/25, 6:48:49 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: 1600H - 2400H

Steam Generation due raw : 2368
Exhaust condensate return : 1802

76.1%
[2/22/25, 6:49:48 AM] R Babu: Apart from that raw sugar colour is intermittently varying without any valid significant reasons. Process team should analyse the reason then only we can correct.  Our target should produce less than 1000 IU colour consistently without compromise in sugar losses.
[2/22/25, 6:52:27 AM] R Babu: Especially most of the times  colour increases in the night shift.   A grain pan boiling and CVP A operation should be more vigilant to produce good quality sugar.
[2/22/25, 6:54:16 AM] R Babu: Apart from the HG centrifugal operator should frequently check the sugar output at conveyor and sugar retention at the basket if the basket retained with colored sugar, empty cycle with water wash shall be performed.
[2/22/25, 6:57:27 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Noted sir, we will do every measure to consistently produce good quality sugar .

[2/22/25, 8:28:46 AM] R Babu: Karl sugar production has to cope up in this shift
[2/22/25, 8:47:24 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. We will cope up the sugar production
[2/22/25, 9:39:43 AM] R Babu: Karl, Clt molasses pty is 45 and C magma pty is 85.  Whether water wash in C-double purging is reduced due to Clt molasses load.
[2/22/25, 9:41:37 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: We have adjusted the wash water in double purging at the start of our shift sir together with Mr @918056290588

[2/22/25, 10:42:06 AM] ~ Murugesan: Good morning 
A and B footing preparation procedure
1. Check the magma quantity is sufficient for footing 
2. Pull magma up to 1st sight glass level 
3. Close the cutover valve and wait for boiling pickup  
4. Increase the magma brix slightly more than the boiling brix 
5. Open the condensate water clean the lower level fine grains 
6. Make sure uniform and sufficient crystal 
7. Wait for boiling brix
8. Start feed with normal boiling brix
9. Feed continuously with normal boiling brix (No batch feeding)
10. No too light and too heavy boiling

[2/24/25, 3:14:32 PM] R Babu: BMA centrifugal machine wash water Nozzle modification work completed and BMA middle machine water wash is perfect and the 1st machine bottom Nozzle to be adjusted slightly.  Informed the operator and technician. Kindly check.
[2/24/25, 3:16:20 PM] R Babu: I am sure and confident that the proposed system will certainly improve the sugar colour in BMA. Let us maintain same load and same washing similar to TKIL machine and observe the colour
[2/24/25, 3:19:32 PM] Skip Tan: Noted Sir.
[2/24/25, 3:21:37 PM] R Babu: Skip/ Jelyn and process team,  let us discuss and arrive solution for how to avoid/ prevent pumping of mud into WWTP through sump pit. Just now I came from WWTP, equalisation tank is with huge mud and it is dense, operator is manually scooping the mud.  How to prevent this. The loading to the WWTP should be only liquid load and not solid load.
[2/24/25, 3:23:01 PM] R Babu: We should have some collection system and only liquid from overflow to pump to WWTP and sludge has to be disposed as solid waste.
[2/24/25, 3:24:47 PM] R Babu: Even the tube cleaning water also, there should be a collection trolley arrangement with strainer and only water has to pass through sump pit and solid scales has to be separated and disposed as solid waste.
[2/24/25, 3:32:42 PM] ~ Murugesan: Good afternoon Mr Karl
What about the B-CVP Nash vacuum pump, servicing completed? and Isolation valve changed?
Because the joker pump is using for B-CVP 1st section 
So at present we don’t have any standby pump ‎<This message was edited>
[2/24/25, 3:40:00 PM] Skip Tan: As per FMD, we will test Nash Pump #4 again. If low vacuum still persist they will dismantle and repair the pump. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/25/25, 7:40:36 AM] R Babu: Juice purity is good, let us target for maximum premium sugar in this week. What is the wash water in HG centrifugals
[2/25/25, 7:48:21 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: It is 4,4 for both TK and BMA sir. Color is already good, we will just wait for 8am analysis just to make sure that production is consistent.
[2/25/25, 7:53:20 AM] R Babu: OK. Good. Let us wait and decide further.
[2/25/25, 7:54:44 AM] R Babu: Continue to divert A-V1 condensate to cogen till cogen condensate tank level builds up. BST tank level is Ok now, once level builds up in cogen divert the V1 to cigar.

[2/25/25, 8:34:48 PM] R Babu: B-M/C pty is continuously high. Reduce the syrup intake in B grain.
[2/25/25, 8:35:54 PM] R Babu: last sample raw sugar colour is high. Any issue, what is the wash water timing
[2/25/25, 8:37:40 PM] R Babu: A-massecuite stock is high, whereas A molasses is nil, whether the HG centrifugal is running
[2/25/25, 8:37:58 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Pressurized pp #3 tripped sir, already shifted to pump #1. Probable cause is due to defective bearing
[2/25/25, 8:40:23 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: This is due to the high viscosity of A-massecuite sir. We already dosed A-molasses to reduce viscocity and diverted portion of massecuite to A1-A5 mixer
[2/25/25, 8:40:46 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, we will minimize syrup intake in B grain
[2/25/25, 8:41:27 PM] R Babu: Pty is 84, how can be viscosity, may be due to high brix
[2/25/25, 8:42:26 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: apologies sir. yes, due to high brix
[2/25/25, 8:44:55 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: High brix will also increase the viscosity. Feed to machines are at minimum, we already made adjustments to normalize massecuite brix
[2/25/25, 8:44:56 PM] R Babu: Molasses pty is also high, keep sufficient movement water in CVP -C to improve the exhaustion
[2/25/25, 8:47:06 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, we will adjust to decrease the final molasses pty
[2/25/25, 8:51:04 PM] R Babu: C-lt and C double purging magma pty is OK, do not reduce further, exhaustion has to be improved in CVP-C.

[2/25/25, 11:22:22 PM] ~ Murugesan: Good evening 
Our B & C massecuite purity is high 
If B-CVP feeding any syrup is there stop immediately please and reduce the syrup consumption for B-grain also 
C-massecuite purity also high so please reduce or stop the syrup consumption for C-grain also
[2/25/25, 11:27:16 PM] ~ Nelson Delfin: Batt D cut in at 2315H for two mills
[2/25/25, 11:31:25 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Good evening sir. We do not feed syrup for CVP-B and for B-grain, syrup feed is at minimum, the rest is A-molasses.
[2/25/25, 11:32:24 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: For C-grain, we will minimize syrup also
[2/25/25, 11:33:26 PM] ~ Murugesan: Good please maintain the basket washing and maintain the molasses purity
[2/25/25, 11:34:35 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: This is noted sir. Thanks
[2/25/25, 11:38:45 PM] ~ Murugesan: I think C-grain no need to syrup because A molasses purity around 65 and C- lite purity around 60 so average C grain purity 62-63 we can get it with out syrup 
Please check and try this one 
C grain purity maintain at 60-62
Thank you ‎<This message was edited>

[2/26/25, 5:27:20 AM] R Babu: Increase the exhaust back pressure to 15-16 psig so that juice temperature shall be maintained.
[2/26/25, 5:30:36 AM] R Babu: Still all massecuite purities are high, balance the purity first, sugar production is so low. Even with high A masecuite purity, raw sugar colour is high.
[2/26/25, 5:37:09 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Noted sir. The temperature reading indicated is that of the outlet temperature going to SRI, reading is lower of the temperature using thermogun by 2 deg C. Instrumentation is currently working on it.
[2/26/25, 5:47:20 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We are adjusting the B-grain purity by using very little syrup only and the rest is A-molasses. The B grain with this ratio just dropped just this 4am so its effect on B-massecuite pty will be reflected for sometime starting now sir.
[2/26/25, 5:53:11 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Sugar sample for 4am was affected by tripped pressurized pump #1 sir. We adjusted opening of pump to prevent it from tripping. Special sample sugar color taken at 0500H is at 1202 IU.

[2/26/25, 7:32:15 AM] R Babu: Sugar production is so low.
[2/26/25, 7:33:08 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We have to slowdown CVP-A sir due to low level of syrup. We will increase again syrup feed once level increase
[2/26/25, 7:40:20 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Juice levels rise during times of low exhaust sir. Steam generation has been erratic for this 1st shift and there have been several mill stoppages also.
[2/26/25, 7:41:45 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Production is not matching with the current milling rate because material is put to stock in equipment required for two mills operation (FS juice clarifier, Battery D, 6k syrup clarifier)
[2/26/25, 7:49:45 AM] R Babu: So sugar will come out in this 2nd shift and match the projection.

B massecuite purity is so high please control the syrup consumption for B grain.
B massecuite to B mol purity drop is around 27 units  please check again.
Please check the A  CVP feed syrup quality any bagasse carryover to syrup?
because the bagasse block our centrifugal basket screen holes 
This one also reason for increasing our sugar colour

[2/26/25, 12:01:15 PM] R Babu: Whether sufficient feed syrup is going for A seed and CVP-A. Still purity is high and grain size seems unusual some bigger and finer grains. Due to high A massecuite pty,  B massecuite pty also high.
[2/26/25, 12:04:29 PM] R Babu: what is the % of syrup used for B grain, reduced to bare minimum or stop. Pty is continuously on higher side. Do not use syrup for C grain.
[2/26/25, 12:30:26 PM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir. 
There is sufficient syrup for CVP-A. Its just that syrup AP is also high.
[2/26/25, 12:30:59 PM] Skip Tan: We adjust Sir depending on temperature.
[2/26/25, 12:31:56 PM] Skip Tan: Thermax IDF tripped off which affected exhaust steam supply.

Double purging is running?
[2/27/25, 10:18:39 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Good evening sir. Double purging was resumed at 2010H, it was stopped prior due to full c lite tank
[2/27/25, 10:21:05 PM] ~ Murugesan: Please check the A mol purity also around 0400 pm A basket wash water reduced for special raw sugar but A mol purity going up
[2/27/25, 10:24:50 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, we will monitor the A-molasses pty. Reduced just now wash time of HG ACBs (BMA:2,1 TK:1,1). Sugar color as 2200H at 894 IU.
[2/27/25, 10:25:27 PM] ~ Murugesan: Please reduce the A mol and maximise the C lite because C lite purity 60+ and our target C grain purity maximum 60 
So please use maximum C lite to avoid the double purging stoppage
[2/27/25, 10:26:22 PM] ~ Murugesan: Good please monitor the material purity and adjust it if necessary
[2/27/25, 10:27:30 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Noted sir. We will fill up BMA #1 with C lite molasses in the event C lite tank will be full.
[2/27/25, 10:50:30 PM] ~ Murugesan: Yes  changing only 25% A mol+25% C lite 
After fondant fill with C lite only
[2/27/25, 10:55:34 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, will do

[2/28/25, 5:10:48 AM] R Babu: Good morning. Still little bit water washing to be reduced in B centrifugal to reduce B magma and B molasses pty.  Reduce the C double purging washing also to maintain C magma pty to 88-90. At present it is 95. Which is very high.
[2/28/25, 5:11:20 AM] R Babu: C seed pty also 67.24, reduce the pty.
[2/28/25, 5:12:09 AM] R Babu: What is the V1 condensate position. Still BST tank levels are low.
[2/28/25, 5:18:20 AM] R Babu: Process team , please gear up for the shift sugar production of 10000 Lkgs. SIC should give special attention to pan boiling and centrifugation for maximise the sugar production. Please discuss with pan boilers and centrifugal operators also for vigilant in their operation and maximise the throughput of their respective operation section. Apart from this 100 % equipment availability in terms of centrifugals, magma and molasses pumps and pressurised hot water pumps and spare equipments should be ready in condition.
[2/28/25, 5:25:53 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Good morning sir, all noted. Battery A and D V1 condensate all go to BST.
[2/28/25, 5:30:23 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: The c grain with 67 pty is already without syrup and utilized A-molasses & c lite with the ratio suggested by Mr. Murugesan. We will adjust sir.
[2/28/25, 7:10:55 AM] ~ Murugesan: Good morning 
Please check the C lite moll, A mol purity from pan supply tanks
[2/28/25, 7:13:51 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir. latest c grain purity is 63.09, same ratio with what you suggested. We will increase the c lite in footing a little bit more.

[2/28/25, 10:43:54 AM] R Babu: Karl, Do not use even 5% syrup to B grain. Let it be with C magma and A molasses.  Since magma pty is 92+, still B massecuite pty is high, subsequently B molasses and B magma pty.
[2/28/25, 10:44:14 AM] R Babu: Still reduce some more water in B centrifugal to reduce B mol and B magma pty
[2/28/25, 10:45:29 AM] ~ lloyd: Amill stpd 0955H-1015H Removed accumulated bagasse at Mill 4 underfeed roller chute. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/28/25, 6:30:18 PM] R Babu: C- basket 4-7 molasses brix is always less, kindle reduce the water wash.
[2/28/25, 6:31:22 PM] R Babu: C lt, C magma and B magma pty is less.  Reduce the wash water in B centrifugals also.
[2/28/25, 6:32:49 PM] R Babu: Reduce the magma qty in A seed and B seed and melt the excess magma in the batch pan utilize for A -seed boiling.
[2/28/25, 6:35:01 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: We already adjusted washings sir. We will monitor purities
[2/28/25, 6:35:08 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Noted sir
[2/28/25, 6:36:39 PM] R Babu: Last two shifts C basket 4-7 brix is low. Inform the operator specifically this machine purity is higher and molasses brix is less
[2/28/25, 6:37:19 PM] R Babu: Hope no syrup for B- graining.
[2/28/25, 6:39:25 PM] R Babu: Since C-lt purity is high, consume Clt only for C grain, once the pty starts decline, A molasses shall be used.
[2/28/25, 6:39:27 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. Informed them to check baskets  and adjust as needed
[2/28/25, 6:40:30 PM] R Babu: Do not use for syrup for B & C boiling and graining
[2/28/25, 6:41:12 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. No syrup utilized for B&C graining already
[2/28/25, 10:13:24 PM] R Babu: Cris, A molasses level is 97 %, so high.  Any issue in B-CVP
[2/28/25, 10:14:25 PM] R Babu: A-Massecuite brix is 88 and 90, so low this low brix inac
[2/28/25, 10:15:29 PM] R Babu: This low brix reduces the crystal yield and increases the A molasses load.  Instruct the CVP-A operator to tighten the A- massecuite brix
[2/28/25, 10:16:10 PM] R Babu: Steam pressure also good, Exhaust 15 psig and V1 9 psig then why the massecuite brix is so low
[2/28/25, 10:20:33 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: I'm waiting for the latest results sir. At 8 pm the night shift operator already made adjustments. We are waiting for the qa results to come out if it needs additional adjustment

[3/2/25, 7:36:36 AM] ~ Rey Eran Valiente: A-mill stopped at 0730H-0736H, due to overload trip of ICC#3.
[3/2/25, 7:36:38 AM] R Babu: Even with 4 evaporator pressure should not be 9 psig
[3/2/25, 7:38:42 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Prior to mill stoppage sir it was 14 psi. Will request Cogen SIC to adjust
[3/2/25, 7:41:37 AM] R Babu: Mill team,  whether A mill stoppage informed to cogen team.  It should be communicated immediately.  It is observed that whenever A mill stoppage, steam pressure is going down drastically. Whether today mill stoppage communicated to cogen or not.
[3/2/25, 7:45:59 AM] ~ Nelson Delfin: Batt D Stopped at 0745H for weekend servicing.
[3/2/25, 7:46:02 AM] ~ Rey Eran Valiente: Yes sir. During A-mill stoppage we immediately informed Cogen and bagasse shed.
[3/2/25, 7:47:33 AM] ~ Alex Dungon: Noted sir, we always informed the bagasse shed personnel/ Cogen whenever there is a mill stoppage
‎[3/2/25, 7:57:46 AM] R Babu: ‎image omitted
[3/2/25, 7:59:53 AM] R Babu: Still pressure and temperature is low. Please be understand one time pressure drops it will take long time to regain to its original back pressure.  Hence please be vigilant and more cautious during A mill stoppage.
[3/2/25, 8:07:37 AM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
We understand this.
And from understanding this, for the same steam flowrate supplied to us, adding another evaporator relieves some  pressure in the line since usage inscreased.

But you are also correct in the first point that steam generstion should not drop just because A-Mill stop since PRDS is there in this case.

[3/2/25, 8:54:14 AM] R Babu: See the difference in sediment, one of the most prominent factor is juice temperature.
[3/2/25, 8:57:46 AM] R Babu: Check the cooling tower water TDS and entrainment again.  Water is so turbid, replenish the water with fresh and pond 12 water
[3/2/25, 8:58:44 AM] R Babu: Cris, whether yesterday fresh water added in the cooling tower for replenishment
[3/2/25, 9:03:19 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Malihao water is continuously supplied to cooling tower through the Nash Pumps sir. It will serve as sealing water first then discharged to the CT.  Old water is continuously pumped to wwtp as well to manage water levels at CT.
[3/2/25, 9:05:17 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Noted sir. We will check TDS and entrainment of CT water.
[3/2/25, 9:06:22 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We will do cleaning of our pump pits starting today as these have contributed to the low quality of our CT water.
[3/2/25, 9:13:53 AM] R Babu: If malihao water is continuously used then there should be improvement in water quality.  Check the individual pan and Evaporator tail pipe water for entrainment
[3/2/25, 9:16:14 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Noted sir. We will check tail pipe water individually
[3/2/25, 9:20:43 AM] ~ Earl John Pabular: Good morning. Requested for the adjustment of milling rate for the mean time due to low exhaust and ongoing liquidation of Battery D. ‎<This message was edited>
‎[3/2/25, 9:22:04 AM] ~ Earl John Pabular: ‎image omitted
[3/2/25, 9:37:19 AM] R Babu: Low steam pressure and all juice tank levels are increased, it will affect the sugar production. During low steam pressure, exhaustion will be very poor and leads to lot of sugar losses and poor cyrstal yield
‎[3/2/25, 9:44:20 AM] ~ Dave: ‎image omitted
[3/2/25, 9:48:45 AM] R Babu: Still cane inventory is high, hence continue the C mill till inventory reaches 180 .

[3/2/25, 10:26:00 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: C-mill stp'd 1025H high level MJ/CJ tanks
[3/2/25, 10:30:55 AM] ~ Earl John Pabular: Requested for C-mill stoppage due to high MJ, CJ, and DSM tank levels resulting from Battery D weekend servicing and accumulation of juice due to insufficient steam generation.
[3/2/25, 10:33:33 AM] R Babu: Reduce the crushing and reduce the juice tank level, do not operate with high level and low steam pressure
[3/2/25, 10:37:35 AM] R Babu: Foaming observed every where in the injection water channel.  Wash the floor and replenish with cold water. Frequent low steam pressure and low vacuum may leads to entrainment.  Please monitor the entrainment also.
[3/2/25, 10:51:13 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: C-mill resumed 1050H

[3/2/25, 5:23:15 PM] R Babu: OK. Immediately after Thermax resumption, pump shall be tried, it is important to keep the steam consumption of refinery less, during tomorrow water boiling
[3/2/25, 7:07:45 PM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Amill stopped at 1906H high level of MJ/ CJ tanks
[3/2/25, 7:15:28 PM] R Babu: Instead of start/ stop of A mill, can we operate the A mill with lesser crushing rate of around 350 tph. So that let us try to operate continuously
[3/2/25, 7:17:56 PM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Copy Sir. We will target 350tph
[3/2/25, 7:18:58 PM] R Babu: Thanks and at the same time bagasse moisture should be in control
[3/2/25, 7:20:57 PM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Noted Sir. Will adjust accordingly

[3/2/25, 8:35:07 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good evening. 
Currently only 3 C-CCBs in operation at LG station due to build up of final molasses caused by Final Scale Molasses Pump no. 4 stoppage. RM currently troubleshooting FSM pump no. 4
[3/2/25, 8:37:53 PM] R Babu: Once Thermax boiler is lined up, start C mill and continue both A & C mill till cane exhausted since cane inventory is high. Tomorrow Cogen will stop TES boiler for maintenance, steam will be supplied through Thermax for process.
[3/2/25, 8:38:25 PM] R Babu: Kindly plan the activities accordingly.
[3/2/25, 8:47:48 PM] R Babu: Why frequently there is a problem with final molasses scale pump. When the pump will be ready
[3/2/25, 8:56:23 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: We are testing right now sir.

Kindly plan accordingly. Depending upon Cogen TES boiler stoppage we will decide the C mill operation continuously if required depends upon the cane inventory.
[3/3/25, 6:32:27 AM] R Babu: Cogen is planning to stop TES boiler for maintenance and hence we will stop the milling operation by 10 AM.  Both A & C mill maintenance shall be planned.
[3/3/25, 6:45:42 AM] R Babu: Skip/ Jelyn please coordinate with Cogen for steam requirement and TES boiler stoppage
[3/3/25, 7:20:04 AM] R Babu: Whether BST Condensate pump to C.J tank tried.  Keep it ready to use

[3/3/25, 7:42:00 AM] R Babu: We are stopping both the mills by 10 AM.
[3/3/25, 7:45:37 AM] R Babu: Since TES boiler will be stopped for maintenance, we cannot continue the crushing due to non availability of
[3/3/25, 7:45:46 AM] Skip Tan: Ok Sir. Our concern is simultaneous stoppage of mills will prolong liquidation and cleaning of batt-A.
[3/3/25, 7:48:41 AM] R Babu: As otherwise we have to stop the plant with cane inventory that will leads to high sugar losses. That I do not want to do it.  If we stop by 10 AM , what will be the time line for A battery to line up again. 8 PM crushing will start with A mill, Plan to start with B,C & D if A battery is not ready.
[3/3/25, 7:52:25 AM] Skip Tan: Batt-A would be ready by midnight, the earlieast.
[3/3/25, 8:02:25 AM] R Babu: OK. A mill with B, C & D battery we can start crushing by 8 pm.
[3/3/25, 8:12:54 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sir, latest update. Electrical connection would be ready by 1pm.
[3/3/25, 8:20:22 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sir @918750599666 can we stop C mill first? exhaust is at 12psig

‎[3/3/25, 8:21:59 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: ‎image omitted
[3/3/25, 8:24:53 AM] R Babu: why the steam pressure and steam flow is less. When both mills are running , it is very less
[3/3/25, 8:30:06 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Cmill resume 0830H
[3/3/25, 8:30:21 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: A-mill Stop 0830H high level of MJ/CJ tanks due to low exhaust
[3/3/25, 8:40:02 AM] R Babu: Stop the A mill for maintenance and continue C mill till 10 am. Since all juice tank level is high, it will take time to liquidation.
[3/3/25, 8:41:46 AM] R Babu: What is the reason for low exhaust
[3/3/25, 8:42:07 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We will ask cogen sir,
[3/3/25, 8:43:24 AM] R Babu: Mill team liquidate A mill for maintenance

[3/3/25, 8:37:17 PM] ~ Nelson Delfin: Batt C was done servicing for level transmitters as per instr team Sir. We are currently hydrotesting all cells to confirm if transmitters are operational. As of now, Batt D is water boiling. We’ll make sure Batt C is ready for service once Mill resumes.
[3/3/25, 9:14:43 PM] Skip Tan: Sir @639284029256, when mills are ready for two mills please coordinate with raw sugar team prior to execution since we need to lower the water level of CT basins to avoid overflow.
Thank you.
[3/3/25, 9:24:31 PM] R Babu: Cris be careful and vigilant, since already cogen condensate tank levels are so low, any stoppage on softener plant will affects the boiler working. Please be watchful. Divert the V1 condensate tp cogen to build up the condensate tank level.
[3/3/25, 9:26:09 PM] ~ hanzel malayo: Hi Skip, I have discussed with Reese our milling scenarios if we can start A-Mill tonight at 11 PM to 12 MN, we may run 2 mills tomorrow at around 6am to 8am if the cane Inventory is still high say around 350 to 400 in order to ensure that it can sustain for 2 mills. But if cane inventory is already more than 550 by 1 am we may also run 2 mills by that time
[3/3/25, 9:26:19 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Noted sir. Batt D V1 condensate was already diverted to Cogen SWT earlier around 2100H

[3/4/25, 5:55:46 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Cold basin at 4.3 ft
Hot basin at 11.6 ft

We are still pumping to wwtp to further reduce the level
[3/4/25, 6:00:38 AM] R Babu: How many cold water and hot water pump is running. Can we increase one hot water pump to balance the basin.  It is the normal practise that cold water basin level should be high, so that even some intermixing of cold water to hot water will not affect the cooling and condensing system
[3/4/25, 6:01:12 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: 4 cold water pumps and 5 hot water pumps currently in operation sir
[3/4/25, 6:02:41 AM] R Babu: Then it is OK, kindly instruct the electrical person to check the motor load and any pump load is less, check for any gland leaks and  gland pack the pumps

[3/4/25, 12:02:27 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. 2 cells of syrup are feeding for CVPB. We will monitor purities and adjust accordingly
[3/4/25, 12:05:27 PM] ~ Murugesan: Mr Karl 
Please increase one more cell 1 to 3 syrup feeding for B CVP and increase the B and C 2nd baskets wash water 
And increase the syrup feeding to B grain also ‎<This message was edited>
[3/4/25, 12:10:14 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Noted on this sir
[3/4/25, 1:50:24 PM] R Babu: Karl, check the A massecuite pty, last sample it is reported as 71 and brix is also 90 only.
[3/4/25, 1:51:39 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. We adjusted awhile ago and just dropped to Amixer.

[3/4/25, 3:52:03 PM] ~ Murugesan: Good afternoon Mr Karl 
The Final molasses purity and 1st stage C magma purity is not matched please check this one 
Please increase the B & A basket wash water to increase the A mol and B magma purity
[3/4/25, 3:55:08 PM] R Babu: There is a requirement of high colour sugar about 2000 IU is required in this month. So immediately after MSDR Monday and Tuesday high colour sugar shall be stored separately in  coordination with warehouse
[3/4/25, 3:55:30 PM] ~ Murugesan: Ok sir
[3/4/25, 4:09:11 PM] R Babu: Kindly add pan aid in the CVP A also till viscosity reduce.  Massecuite is viscous and purging is poor.  Wash the basket with empty cycle to clear the mesh.
[3/4/25, 4:34:31 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, we are now dosing pan aid to A massecuite

[3/4/25, 9:40:49 PM] R Babu: Whether injection water is in closed loop or malihao water for vacuum pump. As discussed balance the Bottle type cooling tower by transfering some vacuum pump water.
[3/4/25, 9:41:43 PM] R Babu: Maintain goos vacuum in CVP-C. Vacuum is low 140 mbar. Which will affect the pan boiling and retards the crystallisation further due to viscosity
[3/4/25, 9:42:00 PM] R Babu: Divert one V1 condensate to BST
[3/4/25, 9:42:39 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: malihao water for vacuum pumps. Bottle type water is supplying sealing water to all RVF,CVP-A vacuum pumps, CVC cooling and molasses cooler
[3/4/25, 9:43:22 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Final scale molasses pump #4 stopped at 2140H to adjust chain and rectify leaking pump casing.
[3/4/25, 9:43:23 PM] R Babu: Please monitor BTC level and do not allow to overflow
[3/4/25, 9:43:25 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir
[3/4/25, 9:44:13 PM] R Babu: What is the latest sugar colour and water wash timing
[3/4/25, 9:48:46 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: 3788 IU as of 2000H sir. we already increased washing to 4,3 for BMA, 3,2 for TK
[3/4/25, 9:49:56 PM] R Babu: How is the viscosity now.
[3/4/25, 9:51:04 PM] R Babu: Keep wash water  4 4 for BMA and TK
[3/4/25, 9:52:46 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Noted sir. It is better than earlier. We will continue to dose pan aid to A-massecuite
[3/4/25, 9:53:40 PM] R Babu: Yes continue the pan aid till viscosity reduces.
[3/4/25, 9:54:20 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: CT basin level continue to decrease sir. We will continue monitoring it
[3/4/25, 9:55:10 PM] R Babu: Pty drop and viscosity may be due to long stoppage and process of prolonged juice boiling in the evaporator to facilitate refinery boiling.
[3/4/25, 9:55:26 PM] R Babu: But still CVP C vacuum is low
[3/4/25, 9:59:29 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We are gradually increasing the injection pressure to improve the vacuum sir, from 142 mbar it is now 138 mbar. We try to avoid sudden increase in pressure as it may cause imbalance in the CT basins and may cause overflow
[3/4/25, 10:02:19 PM] R Babu: OK
[3/4/25, 10:06:40 PM] R Babu: Mr. Marlow and Chimee whether the refinery reject line to A molasses tank work is completed. If not complete ASAP. This help to divert the refinery syrup to A molasses when the pty is lower than 75. Refinery has to check the pty and divert the reject either to syrup or molasses tank. This work has to be completed with top priority
 Please coordinate with raw house and do it immediately
[3/4/25, 10:08:25 PM] ~ Nelson Delfin: Batt A V1 diverted to Cigar at 2150H
[3/4/25, 10:09:16 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: The line was already installed by the raw house sir.
[3/4/25, 10:09:27 PM] R Babu: Skip/ Jelyn above is the communication to refinery please coordinate and complete, this will maintain the A-M/C pty . Since we are planning to reduce the refinery syrup pty below 74-75, sometimes it will be 72.  Above 75 let it used used in A-Massecuite, if it is less than 75 consume in B boiling depending upon the raw sugar production plan.
[3/4/25, 10:09:48 PM] R Babu: Is it with isolation valve
[3/4/25, 10:09:54 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Yes sir
[3/4/25, 10:13:29 PM] R Babu: Thanks for the update jelyn
[3/4/25, 10:15:27 PM] R Babu: Mac, balance the A molasses in C grain and B boiling,  level is continuously high.
[3/4/25, 10:16:09 PM] R Babu: If Clt pty is less feed in CVP C One compartment
[3/4/25, 10:19:23 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: Hi @639091795139 @639339940762 as instructed by Mr Babu, we will notify Raw House SIC on the following Refinery Syrup AP:
1. If AP is 74-75 and above divert to Syrup tank for A massecuite boiling.
2. If AP is below 74 please divert to A molasses.
We will coordinate accordingly. Thank you Jelyn and skip for immediate installation of diversion line.
[3/4/25, 10:20:10 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Noted sir. As of now, we are still feeding syrup to 2 cells of CVP-B. If B-massecuite pty is back to normal we will revert to A-molasses feed instead of syrup to decrease A-molasses levels ‎<This message was edited>
[3/4/25, 10:27:55 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted sir
[3/4/25, 10:41:33 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: RM needs to replace the chain of final scale pump #4. Can we divert to MT #7 for the meantime while RM is working on pp #4?@918750599666 . Whse supervisor is still waiting on the approval of Ms Debbie.

[3/5/25, 4:50:23 AM] R Babu: Good morning Cris. Still CVP-C vacuum is less. Injection water is in closed loop or Malihao water to vacuum pumps
[3/5/25, 4:51:10 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good morning sir. This is Malihao water
[3/5/25, 4:51:59 AM] R Babu: What is the latest raw sugar colour.  A-massecuite stock is high, how many machines are running. What is the water washing time. How is the viscosity of A- massecuite
[3/5/25, 4:55:11 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: A-masse viscosity has greatly improved. 8 machines are currently running. The build-up was caused by A molasses congestion. I am maximizing CVP-B operations to reduce the A-mol level so that we can maximize HG production as well
[3/5/25, 4:55:34 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Current wash time is 4,3 for BMA and 3,3 for TK
[3/5/25, 4:56:29 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Latest color is 0200H sample at 1808. Waiting for 0400H results
[3/5/25, 4:58:27 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: 0400H is 1760 IU
[3/5/25, 4:59:16 AM] R Babu: Good to hear that. Thanks for the feedback. Once the viscosity reduces, sugar colour and purities will improve.
[3/5/25, 5:01:01 AM] R Babu: Good. Do not increase the water wash. Let us monitor further.
[3/5/25, 5:02:25 AM] R Babu: What about syrup to CVP-B boiling
[3/5/25, 5:05:33 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Still feeding 1 cell syrup at CVP B sir. If the purity continues to rise, I will stop feeding syrup
[3/5/25, 5:08:46 AM] R Babu: OK.
[3/5/25, 5:59:53 AM] R Babu: Cris, push the HG centrifugal operation to maximise the sugar production.  House stock is high. We have to maximise the maximise the CVP's throughput and centrifugal operation
[3/5/25, 6:00:55 AM] R Babu: Sediment level is so high, what is the latest Sediment level
[3/5/25, 6:02:20 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Latest at 0400H is 212
[3/5/25, 7:31:14 AM] R Babu: A-Massecuite brix is continuously low. Day average is 89.8 %, which is also one  of the reason for higher A molasses

[3/5/25, 8:10:11 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. We will adjust syrup brix pushing to panfloor
[3/5/25, 8:55:07 AM] ~ Murugesan: Good morning 
Please continue with one cell syrup feed for B CVP up to B massecuite purity reach 67-68 ‎<This message was edited>
[3/5/25, 8:58:02 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Good morning. Yes sir, syrup feeding is continuous for CVP-B
[3/5/25, 8:59:05 AM] ~ Murugesan: Mr Karl 
Where you add pan aid for A massecuite?
[3/5/25, 9:29:12 AM] R Babu: Where is the V1 condensate diversion
[3/5/25, 9:34:59 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. Pan aid dosing is continuous
[3/5/25, 9:36:57 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Batt A V1 is going to BST while Batt D is to Cogen SCT sir

‎[3/5/25, 9:38:07 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: ‎image omitted
[3/5/25, 10:23:56 AM] R Babu: Karl add the pan aid in the CVP feed, if there is no provision add it in the  A seed pan
[3/5/25, 10:24:47 AM] R Babu: Even with lesser A massecuite load in the centrifugal,  raw sugar colour is high. Massecuite is still viscous
[3/5/25, 10:24:49 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. Same as with B seed pan
[3/5/25, 10:25:21 AM] R Babu: Yes it should be in the pan so that CVP A boiling will be improved
[3/5/25, 10:29:45 AM] R Babu: Karl C massecuite level seems high. How many C basket is running
[3/5/25, 10:33:05 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: 7 C1 baskets are operational sir with max load already. We are just balancing the levels sir since pugmill is also high
[3/5/25, 10:39:42 AM] R Babu: C grain media shall be Syrup  plus A molasses and after pondant addition Clt shall be fed. Balance Clt shall be fed into CVP C in one or two compartment depending upon Clt level
[3/5/25, 10:40:33 AM] R Babu: Still Clt pty improve to 55+. Still A, B & C massecuite is highly viscous
[3/5/25, 10:41:21 AM] R Babu: Increase the pan aid 7.5 kgs per batch pan of A seed Still viscosity reduce
[3/5/25, 10:45:56 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: This all noted sir. We will adjust accordingly
[3/5/25, 10:46:47 AM] R Babu: Whenever Clt molasses is full and double purging stopped it should be texted here. When the pty drops as discussed earlier it should be consume in CVP C.
[3/5/25, 10:49:18 AM] R Babu: Mr. Murugesan please train the Pan boiler to adopt the standard boiling and boiling conditions suitable for the prevailing process materials pty.
[3/5/25, 10:49:28 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Okay sir. Already started feeding clight molasses to CVP-C sir
[3/5/25, 10:49:57 AM] ~ Murugesan: Ok sir
[3/5/25, 10:53:28 AM] R Babu: It is your prime responsibility to train the  A,B and C operators and they should be in a position to inform material is viscous,  pty is less. After our physical inspection and dosing pan aid and adjusting purity etc is just like post mortem.
[3/5/25, 10:54:29 AM] R Babu: Clt molasses has to be balanced at the same time raw sugar quality and sugar losses should be in control

[3/6/25, 2:27:39 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: We will do our best sir not to disrupt double purging operations. Despite 2 cells feeding at CVP-C, C-light mol tank fills up quickly.
[3/6/25, 6:09:25 AM] R Babu: Good morning Cris. C single cured magma, C double purge magma, B magma purities were abnormally low. C single cured magma 52.78, it is almost like C-Massecuite. Please check the centrifugals and wash the basket one by one. Increase the washing in all C basket, C double purging and B centrifugals.  Non sugar circulation is high due to that only high molasses load.
[3/6/25, 6:10:13 AM] R Babu: Continue the pan aid in all A, B & C.
[3/6/25, 6:12:53 AM] R Babu: Since Clt pty is very less, use after the grain hardening to fill up along with A-hy and consume in CVP-C 2nd & 3rd compartment.
[3/6/25, 6:14:19 AM] R Babu: Due to higher viscosity, crystal % massecuite is less and resulting higher molasses load. Please check the pan boiling and post the massecuite sample photos.
[3/6/25, 6:15:23 AM] R Babu: Where the refinery syrup is diverted whether in syrup or A molasses
[3/6/25, 6:16:43 AM] R Babu: Especially check the B- massecuite quality seems poor, crystal % massecuite is low and B magma pty is 77.
[3/6/25, 6:19:15 AM] R Babu: 4 AM raw sugar colour is very high, what is the latest colour sediment. Sediment also continuously high. Check the flat screen working. Whether DSM screen lined up
[3/6/25, 6:19:33 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Syrup tank sir. Last ref syrup is 76 AP
[3/6/25, 6:20:54 AM] R Babu: Good. Please divert according to pty.
[3/6/25, 6:26:10 AM] R Babu: Cris, sugar production has not matching with projected lkgtc.  A-massecuite stock is high. Whether HG centrifugals frequently stopped for A molasses stock
[3/6/25, 6:26:45 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Yes sir. We cannot maximize HG due to high A-mol level
[3/6/25, 6:30:48 AM] R Babu: Please check the B-grain and B- massecuite, all problems start with B. If we improve B, A molasses load will be reduced, B magma quality will be good and in turn improves raw sugar colour.
[3/6/25, 6:31:17 AM] R Babu: Check the HG basket also for any liner damage, which will also increase A mol load.
[3/6/25, 6:32:28 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Copy sir
[3/6/25, 6:37:30 AM] ~ Murugesan: Good morning Cris 
Please check the C lite and C magma 2nd stage purity is not matching 
C lite is 43 and Magma is 85 
Collect one from respective storage send it to QAQC
[3/6/25, 6:56:49 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Double purging stopped at 0600H
[3/6/25, 7:08:44 AM] ~ Murugesan: Ok, some time continue with single purging and consume more A mol to C grain 
Continue feed C lite mol 2 cells to C CVP 
Once A mol under control increase the number of A basket and wash time also

[3/6/25, 7:12:12 AM] ~ Murugesan: Please try to maintain the Molasses and Massecuite purity
then only we can control the house load 
More non sugar circulating in the house we need to reduce it ‎<This message was edited>

[3/6/25, 7:20:58 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Can we stop double purging for a while sir? 1st stage magma already has very fine grains. The operator is struggling to develop the seed. Which affects the quality of the resulting B-massecuite
[3/6/25, 7:33:58 AM] ~ Murugesan: Yes 
Please check the C massecuite crystal size and uniformity 
If size is very small, reduce the grain quantity

[3/6/25, 7:40:59 AM] ~ Murugesan: For B grain 
Pull C magma up to 1st sight glass level and wait for boiling pick up 
Increase the brix more than the normal boiling brix 
Wash properly with condensate water and wait for boiling brix then start feed Syrup to develop the grains properly
[3/6/25, 7:48:57 AM] ~ Murugesan: For B CVP boiling 
1st cell feed hot water 
2nd and 3rd feed syrup 
4th to 7th feed A mol
8th feed hot water 
From 9th, 3 or 4 cells feed A mol ‎<This message was edited>
[3/6/25, 7:54:39 AM] ~ Murugesan: Please give the instructions to the Panman for maintain the massecuite quality
[3/6/25, 7:54:59 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Noted sir. Thank you
[3/6/25, 8:43:46 AM] R Babu: Karl, do not reduce the water wash in B centrifugal due to high B molasses load. B molasses brix is 86-87 which is very high,  resulting 39 pty which is very very low.
[3/6/25, 8:43:58 AM] R Babu: Increase the wash in B centrifugal.
[3/6/25, 8:59:07 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir

[3/6/25, 9:26:43 AM] R Babu: Thanks for the update
[3/6/25, 9:27:50 AM] R Babu: Whether DSM screen is lined up. Sediment level is continuously high. Maintain mixed juice heater temperature 104 minimum.
[3/6/25, 9:30:51 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: We will try sir since we have stoppages at HG station due to very high amol tanks level. We are adjusting with the Bseed graining since cmagma has fine grains which is very hard to develop. We will remelt cmagma
[3/6/25, 9:32:49 AM] ~ Justine Cientos: Copy sir. DSM Screen is also in operation.
[3/6/25, 9:38:04 AM] R Babu: ‎This message was deleted.
[3/6/25, 9:55:05 AM] ~ Murugesan: Good morning Karl 
C magma is fine grain means C massecuite crystal size is small please check the C massecuite  crystal size.
If very hard to develop the grain pull magma up to top tube plate level and take some syrup melt it properly and make graining with slurry or refined sugar 
Once magma crystal size is normal then we go for B footing
[3/6/25, 9:58:22 AM] ~ Murugesan: Please make sure the B grain crystal size should not be small size otherwise it will affect B massecuite crystal size and A massecuite crystal size also
[3/6/25, 9:59:03 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. We're doing the graining at Bseed using refined sugar. We will just recover and normalize Bseed
[3/6/25, 9:59:25 AM] ~ Murugesan: Good
[3/6/25, 10:00:30 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: As for Cseed graining, Amol and syrup was used. While clight mol was feeding to CVPC
[3/6/25, 10:00:42 AM] ~ Murugesan: If need please use pan# 7 also for B grain
[3/6/25, 10:02:28 AM] ~ Murugesan: Once low purity C lite mol completely empty then start C double purging then continue running without stoppage
[3/6/25, 10:04:51 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. Can we target Cseed purity to 64-65 first to recover also with the grain size?
[3/6/25, 10:05:25 AM] ~ Murugesan: Please adjust the basket wash water to maintain the molasses purity 
We need to reduce the non sugar quantity recycle in the house otherwise the same problem will continue again and again ‎<This message was edited>

If A & B molasses load under control please increase the A and B basket wash water to increase the molasses purity ‎<This message was edited>
[3/6/25, 1:44:04 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Good afternoon. This is noted sir
[3/6/25, 2:13:15 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Batt A V1 diverted to SCT at 1410H, Batt D V1 diverted to Cigar at 1405H
[3/6/25, 2:42:36 PM] R Babu: Karl check the cooling tower level. WSP is stopped due to cooling tower overflow at 02.30 pm. Please check
[3/6/25, 2:42:56 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: He is checking it right now sir
[3/6/25, 3:04:04 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: It was caused by the sudden closing of condenser water control valve sir that leads to over pressure of cold water line.
[3/6/25, 3:04:30 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: FSM pp#4 stopped at 1450H due to poor delivery. Ongoing check-up of RM
[3/6/25, 3:06:20 PM] R Babu: OK. Whether overflow is stopped now
[3/6/25, 3:08:07 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. It was then relieved by the operator balancing the water pressure not to overflow going to the lower portion of the canal
[3/6/25, 3:17:05 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: @639162655633 @639561759646 please check which injection valves suddenly closed. Thank you.
[3/6/25, 3:20:47 PM] ~ Justine Cientos: Requested mills to slowdown milling rate
[3/6/25, 3:24:50 PM] R Babu: Still B molasses brix is so high. Increase the water wash and check the basket for liner choke. Kindly wash the basket with water.
[3/6/25, 3:25:08 PM] R Babu: Similarly C basket also wash with water
[3/6/25, 3:25:25 PM] R Babu: What is the wash water timer in HG centrifugal
[3/6/25, 3:26:17 PM] R Babu: Still B magma pty is so low resulting higher colour of raw sugar with lower pol.
[3/6/25, 3:27:03 PM] R Babu: Increase the wash water timing in HG centrifugal also. What is present wash water timing
[3/6/25, 3:28:09 PM] ~ lloyd: Reduced milling rate.
Amill - 46hz / 640 gpm
Cmill - 80% / 340 gpm
[3/6/25, 3:28:32 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. We are adjusting since Bmasse and Cmasse quality is poor

[3/6/25, 3:29:44 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Current wash time at HG centrifugals are 2,3 sir. We will adjust, sir once amol congestion is relief
[3/6/25, 3:32:54 PM] R Babu: To release the A molasses congestion we have to increase the pty. Increase the wash water to 4,4 for all TK and BMA machine.
[3/6/25, 3:36:27 PM] R Babu: Jelyn if required reduce the crushing little bit to release the house stock, increase the water wash in HG centrifugal,  once the pty normalised, we can regulate the washing again
[3/6/25, 3:37:24 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted sir we will coordinate with sir hanzel
[3/6/25, 3:37:27 PM] R Babu: As otherwise situation will worsen further
[3/6/25, 3:41:44 PM] ~ hanzel malayo: Already reduced the crushing rate of both mills
[3/6/25, 3:42:33 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Thank you sir
[3/6/25, 3:43:35 PM] R Babu: Thanks Hanzel for your kind understanding.  Very high viscosity observed for the past two days, resulting higher house load. Once purities improve we can increase the crushing
[3/6/25, 3:59:15 PM] ~ Murugesan: Good afternoon @639162655633
Please follow the formula for C grain preparation up to purity improvement 
Charge 25% syrup + 25% A mol 
After fondant 10% syrup + 40% A mol
This formula we can increase the Purity and consumption of A mol also 
So we can increase the A basket wash time
[3/6/25, 4:01:29 PM] ~ Murugesan: Please continue pan aid for all massecuite boiling’s
[3/6/25, 4:08:01 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. Continue dosing of pan aid at all pan developings

[3/6/25, 7:54:43 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: Raw sugar SIC. Please coordinate with Refined SIC by allowing them to pump the ref syrup intermittently to Amol tank because level is  approaching to full already. Thanks.
[3/6/25, 7:58:01 PM] ~ Murugesan: Mr Karl 
Please Check the A mol tank level if some empty is there take refinery reject mol part by part. Don’t take whole quantity in one time 
Take aprox 5 Mt first and stop the pump and wait for some time and check the A mol tank level then take again 
Like this take means both sides we can manage the load ‎<This message was edited>

[3/7/25, 5:07:01 AM] R Babu: Why it was stopped.  It was told to continue still viscosity reduces.
[3/7/25, 5:12:53 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Initially dosing is at A-masse discharge sir. and we are still dosing there. Dosing at A-seed pan was added to further address viscosity
[3/7/25, 5:24:26 AM] R Babu: Increase the pan aid 7.5 kgs per batch pan of A seed Still viscosity reduce
[3/7/25, 5:27:35 AM] R Babu: Day before yesterday above instructions given
[3/7/25, 5:55:51 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Apologies sir. The instruction was confused with A-massecuite not A-seed. We will increase pan aid dosing.

[3/7/25, 7:10:31 AM] ~ Murugesan: C massecuite still single purging ?
[3/7/25, 7:10:37 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good morning sir. Amol load is at 46% only. However A massecuite mixers are already full due to limited loading at baskets
[3/7/25, 7:10:40 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Yes sir
[3/7/25, 7:12:07 AM] ~ Murugesan: Please start double purging with good wash water to maintain the C lite and C magma purity
[3/7/25, 7:12:21 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Yes sir it is small and very fine. This is probably the result of yesterday's poor magma quality from the backend
[3/7/25, 7:12:28 AM] R Babu: Sugar crystal lattice also not seems hexagon.  Please check for any needle crystal.
[3/7/25, 7:31:09 AM] ~ Murugesan: Please check the grain feed and grain size 
If need reduce the grain quantity to increase the massecuite crystal size

[3/7/25, 7:35:08 AM] ~ Murugesan: Please check the B grain preparation
Still fondant method or footing method for B graining?
[3/7/25, 7:36:19 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: We did 1 pan fondant method then cut to other pan and 1 pan using footing.
[3/7/25, 7:40:02 AM] ~ Murugesan: If B magma size is very small,
Check the B grain size still it’s small cut to other pan to increase the B grain dropping size 
Immediately we need to focus on this one 
Increase the B magma crystal size and increase the A massecuite crystal size also

[3/7/25, 11:54:26 AM] R Babu: Clarified syrup pty is 74, whereas last CVP-A massecuite pty is 71, it clearly indicates B magma quality pulls the A massecuite quality. What is the wash water temperature of hot water used for B centrifugal, is it possible to increase. Increase the wash water in B-centrifugals
[3/7/25, 11:57:00 AM] R Babu: Pressurised hot water temperature is 89 deg, increase the temperature, if required open the sporger steam still our viscosity and purity problem solved
[3/7/25, 11:57:12 AM] Jarjolen Jamora: Mr Russel commits to finish this afternoon. FYI, thanks.
[3/7/25, 12:04:54 PM] ~ Murugesan: Our B magma purity is 73, C magma purity is 65
This low purity affecting our grain quality followed by massecuite quality also and more non sugar and colouring matters circulating in the house 
Please increase the wash water for B & C baskets to increase the magma purity
[3/7/25, 12:07:10 PM] ~ Murugesan: Please maintain the C magma purity 80+ and B magma purity 85+
[3/7/25, 2:19:04 PM] ~ lloyd: Cmill started 1420H for liquidation.
[3/7/25, 2:42:21 PM] ~ lloyd: Stpd 1443H finished liquidation.
[3/7/25, 3:39:46 PM] ~ lloyd: Amill stpd 1538H due to high MJ/CJ tanks.
[3/7/25, 4:44:43 PM] ~ lloyd: Resumed 1605H
[3/7/25, 6:09:24 PM] ~ lloyd: Amill stpd 1740H-1810H Full MJ/CJ tanks.
‎[3/7/25, 7:29:27 PM] ~ lloyd: ‎image omitted
[3/7/25, 7:29:34 PM] R Babu: Whether B molasses is diverted to molasses tank.
[3/7/25, 7:33:22 PM] R Babu: Last B magma pty improved to 83.20. It is a good sign. It has to reach 90. Continue to make good grain and high water wash in B- centrifugal
[3/7/25, 7:33:45 PM] R Babu: Whether A molasses fed to CVP-C boiling
‎[3/7/25, 7:34:44 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: ‎image omitted
[3/7/25, 7:34:50 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Sir @918750599666
[3/7/25, 7:36:27 PM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
[3/7/25, 7:36:52 PM] Skip Tan: Already done.
[3/7/25, 7:37:42 PM] R Babu: It is dextran analysis. What about starch analysis
[3/7/25, 7:37:59 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: For a while sir
[3/7/25, 7:38:37 PM] R Babu: Hope B molasses is continuously going out.
[3/7/25, 7:39:54 PM] Skip Tan: Low AP B-mol was already replaced by a-mol sir.
[3/7/25, 7:40:39 PM] Skip Tan: We emptied the B-mol tank before filling with A-mol.
[3/7/25, 7:41:48 PM] R Babu: What about present B- curing B molasses. Is it going to molasses tank or not
[3/7/25, 7:43:35 PM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
But CVP-B is on standby due to high B-magma level.
[3/7/25, 7:44:15 PM] Skip Tan: Material in B-mol tank now is A-Mol.
[3/7/25, 7:47:58 PM] R Babu: Once B-centrifugal started again, B molasses has to be sent out to molasses tank. B magma shall be melted in the batch pan and consumed in Seed pan and CVP A
[3/7/25, 7:48:36 PM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
This is what we are doing now.
[3/7/25, 7:49:17 PM] R Babu: Raw sugar production is 76 lkgs only. How is the A massecuite quality now. How many machines are running
[3/7/25, 7:52:15 PM] Skip Tan: Only 4 ACBs at 35% loading. 40% loading increases vibration of ACBs.
Mixer still has residual poor quality massecuite.
CVP-A grains are still being improved to increase ACB fill setting.
BP for strike is brixing.
HG Mixer is almost ready to receive the pan strike.
[3/7/25, 8:46:46 PM] R Babu: Still problem get solved instruct the lab to analyse the B and C magma pty once in hour and record the same in daily laboratory  sheet.
[3/7/25, 8:47:41 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Right now it's only 2 baskets in operation, heavy vibration at HG ACB #1 - #3 ( titan / BMA)
[3/7/25, 8:48:15 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We will empty the HG mixer before striking. FYI
[3/7/25, 9:11:47 PM] ~ Alex Dungon: A - mill stopped at 2105H, as requested by Raw house
[3/7/25, 9:28:46 PM] R Babu: If the present massecuite quality is good,  it can be dropped in separate crystalliser and mix with old massecuite in the feed mixer
[3/7/25, 9:42:38 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We don't have spare crystallizer right now sir
[3/7/25, 9:43:47 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: a mixer right now is at 30%, material was very viscous. If we mix with new production our ACBs still cannot manage it.
[3/7/25, 9:55:21 PM] ~ Alex Dungon: A- mill resumed at 2153H
[3/7/25, 9:57:07 PM] R Babu: ok
[3/7/25, 10:45:31 PM] R Babu: Jelyn/ Karl is it possible to drain the mixer material and collect in the bags so that we can reprocess it later. Last hour also sugar production is 5.8 lkgs means no load.  It is prolonging the operation.
[3/7/25, 10:46:13 PM] R Babu: Longer time stoppage of holding CVP A & B material will deteriorate.
[3/7/25, 10:46:20 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We are draining it now sir, and we send it to c magma mingler,
[3/7/25, 10:46:44 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We are now searching for additional drums sir for storage
[3/7/25, 10:47:01 PM] R Babu: Drain and keep it separately we can reprocess it later.
[3/7/25, 10:48:14 PM] R Babu: The other option is take the massecuite load in the basket and dissolve it completely with hot water and that A molasses shall be consumed in C boiling
[3/7/25, 10:49:50 PM] R Babu: Drain the material in the floor with bund wall with sand bags and later collected in the bags. This will fasten the work. As otherwise if we drain with this rate, again there will be problem
[3/7/25, 10:49:50 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We don't have provision sir for that, we are trying everything so that mixer for 1-5 will be emptied, while 3 available units or G 16 are running right now
[3/7/25, 10:50:01 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We already doing it sir

[3/7/25, 10:53:38 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: It's from titan sir , we are trying to purge also
[3/7/25, 10:55:59 PM] R Babu: It is like C single purging sugar. It seems lot of dust and false , very difficult to purge in batch centrifugal.
[3/7/25, 10:56:48 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Yes sir, that's why I'm sending it right now to low grade, but still we are trying to purge with G16 baskets
[3/7/25, 10:57:37 PM] R Babu: The best way to drain and collect or wash the massecuite in basket itself and sent out as A molasses.
[3/7/25, 10:58:54 PM] R Babu: If the false grain is due to starch, again it will have issue in B boiling. Best way to collect the sugar in bund and later we will use.
[3/7/25, 10:59:27 PM] R Babu: Once the massecuite is emptied in mixer wash with hot water
[3/7/25, 10:59:55 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Yes sir, that is our plan
[3/7/25, 11:01:30 PM] R Babu: How fast we will empty that fast we will retrive the operation. Now also in HG basket frequently wash the basket screen with hot water since viscous false grain clogg the liner
[3/7/25, 11:15:06 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: For BMA and TKII we already do that sir, so that when we strike BP#2 it is all clear.
[3/7/25, 11:16:10 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We understand it sir, we are also trying everything to fasten the liquidation of material
[3/7/25, 11:16:39 PM] R Babu: Thanks for the relief news. Please ask Karl post the BP#2 massecuite
‎[3/7/25, 11:21:03 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: ‎image omitted
[3/7/25, 11:25:31 PM] R Babu: Far  better than last 2 days crystal. Hope it will be cured in basket without any issue. Once the massecuite dropped keep the wash water also 4, 4 seconds or 5, 5 seconds depends upon raw sugar colour and A molasses pty
[3/7/25, 11:27:29 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We will also send sample for analysis sir
[3/7/25, 11:27:52 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Right now sir washing for G16 is at 7,7
[3/7/25, 11:30:30 PM] R Babu: In G16 try with 10 10 whether all massecuite is dissolved and pass into A molasses so that curing will be past

‎[3/8/25, 6:28:08 AM] R Babu: ‎image omitted
[3/8/25, 6:29:35 AM] R Babu: Good morning. There are lot of needle crystal in the sample. It clearly shows the presence of Dextran.
[3/8/25, 6:32:11 AM] R Babu: Since crushing is less, kindly liquidate the CVP-A one by one compartment and do the water boiling and take back the CVP-A in line again. First liquidate one compartment and water boil, take that compartment in line and next compartment shall be stopped for water boiling
[3/8/25, 6:33:18 AM] R Babu: Is it possible transfer the CVP-A to batch pan and slightly wash the fine and drop in receiver
[3/8/25, 6:33:52 AM] R Babu: In Batch pan needly shaped crystal is less when compares with CVP
[3/8/25, 6:35:52 AM] R Babu: Mill team please wash the mill gutters, juice receiving tank with steam wash. Especially in the C mill cush cush conveyors, A mill and C mill shredder pit area.
[3/8/25, 6:36:23 AM] R Babu: For mill imbibition use complete hot water, do not use cold water.
[3/8/25, 6:37:55 AM] ~ Alex Dungon: This is noted sir

[3/8/25, 6:42:36 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: We will do this sir once HG mixer is at manageable level
[3/8/25, 6:42:59 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sir, we are now maximizing batch pans for A strike. If we have space in pan boiling we will stop and liquidate CVP A sir
[3/8/25, 6:45:28 AM] R Babu: what is HG centrifugal loading
[3/8/25, 6:57:43 AM] R Babu: Jelyn/ Karl whether B-CVP is boiling now.
[3/8/25, 6:58:50 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir
[3/8/25, 6:59:11 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: 60% for BMA and 40% for TK

[3/8/25, 7:15:16 AM] R Babu: Good to see 75 pty. There is a improvement. Thanks Karl for the update
[3/8/25, 7:15:25 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. The results is posted at the rightmost part of the dlr besides cmasse
‎[3/8/25, 7:15:54 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: ‎image omitted
[3/8/25, 7:18:15 AM] R Babu: Yes, I have seen. B magma pty improved to 88, good. Whereas C magma pty mentioned as 46. It is not even C-massecuite pty. Kindly check is there any molasses mixing with C magma. Reduce the C massecuite load to C basket and increase the wash water
[3/8/25, 7:19:34 AM] R Babu: Hope the CVp-C is fed with A molasses and B molasses is sent out.
[3/8/25, 7:23:20 AM] R Babu: Check the C magma Karl, pty reported 46. It is less than C massecuite pty. Whether molasses is mixing and liners clogged with fine dust. Please wash the centrifugal machine one by one  with steam and water wash  and check the pty again
‎[3/8/25, 7:23:46 AM] ~ Dave: ‎image omitted
[3/8/25, 7:28:45 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. Will check this one
[3/8/25, 7:34:24 AM] R Babu: Do you have facility to wash with steam
[3/8/25, 7:43:12 AM] ~ hanzel malayo: Good Morning Sir. Only process condensate is available now in the mills
[3/8/25, 7:46:15 AM] R Babu: OK. Water temperature is 62 only. Kindly check any cold water make up.
[3/8/25, 7:47:05 AM] ~ hanzel malayo: Noted Sir, will do
[3/8/25, 7:47:44 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. I make up cold water since little condensate is going to the pressurized tank
[3/8/25, 7:47:58 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: I already diverted batt A V1 condensate to cigar
[3/8/25, 7:48:33 AM] R Babu: Karl, pressurised water tank hot water temperature is 68 only. Very low. Temperature is very important in this crucial period.
[3/8/25, 7:48:44 AM] R Babu: Divert both V1 condensate to cigar
[3/8/25, 7:49:24 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. Only batt A is operational and already diverted it to cigar
[3/8/25, 7:50:52 AM] R Babu: Cogen 40 Ft condensate tank level is 70 %, 60 % and SCT is 85 %.  V1 always keep in cigar, whenever cogen tanks are low or if they request we can consider based on the BST and process usage
[3/8/25, 7:52:10 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Noted sir
[3/8/25, 7:54:48 AM] R Babu: Stop the cold water to pressurised tank and if required make up water from BST. If required open the sporger steam for pressurised tank
[3/8/25, 7:57:54 AM] ~ Alex Dungon: A- mill stopped at 0753H, as requested by Raw house
[3/8/25, 8:37:30 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir
[3/8/25, 8:43:37 AM] ~ Ronalee: A-Mill resume at 0840H
‎[3/8/25, 8:57:25 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: ‎image omitted
[3/8/25, 8:59:16 AM] R Babu: Mac Pty seems improved and quality improved.  but still lot of needle shaped crystal and grain size is small. Can we increase the size.
[3/8/25, 9:01:57 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Yes sir, we will endeavor to increase the grain size more. BMA #2 is still on brixing
[3/8/25, 9:04:01 AM] R Babu: Definitely there is a improvement in quality, hope it will improve further. Thanks Mac for the update
[3/8/25, 9:12:24 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We will cut-in Battery C to address the shortage in condensate. This will improve C magma pty as there are instances where C baskets don't have enough supply of condensate
[3/8/25, 9:15:02 AM] R Babu: Kindly take it. You can take the condensate from BST also
[3/8/25, 10:06:25 AM] ~ Earl John Pabular: Battery C cut-in @ 0945H.
[3/8/25, 10:52:19 AM] R Babu: Mac how many HG centrifugal machine is running and what is the loading. HG receiver level is high again
[3/8/25, 10:54:49 AM] Skip Tan: It is high due to new pan strike.
ACBs are resuming.
[3/8/25, 11:00:28 AM] R Babu: ok. How many machine will run. Increase the wash water temperature.
[3/8/25, 11:01:17 AM] R Babu: A mol is 100 % and B mol 72 %, hope A mol is fed to CVP-C
[3/8/25, 11:02:05 AM] R Babu: Again sugar colour is increasing. Raw sugar also let them analyse every hour, please inform lab accordingly
[3/8/25, 11:05:30 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: only TK #4 not operational sir. ongoing replacement of lining screen
[3/8/25, 11:05:54 AM] ~ Allan Maravilla: will relay to our lab sir.
[3/8/25, 11:06:57 AM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
Since there is still mix of remaining poor massecuite from CVP-A.
[3/8/25, 11:07:22 AM] R Babu: Thanks Allan.
[3/8/25, 11:07:49 AM] R Babu: when can we start the water boiling of CVP_A .
[3/8/25, 11:09:01 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We will feed A-mol once the B-mol tank level is safe. Currently, pug mill and C massecuite tank are high level. We are now maximizing LG purging by operating C-CCBs #1-#3.
[3/8/25, 11:09:24 AM] Skip Tan: Planned on Monday Sir.
[3/8/25, 11:09:51 AM] Skip Tan: We will do continuous milling with C-mill on monday.
[3/8/25, 11:10:35 AM] Skip Tan: Transfer to A-mill after servicing then two mills after Batt-A cleaning.
[3/8/25, 11:10:58 AM] R Babu: Increase the water wash in C basket to eliminate the maximum non sugar.  Even little bit higher final molasses pty is OK.
[3/8/25, 11:11:15 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir
[3/8/25, 11:12:41 AM] R Babu: If only A mill is running now, can we plan now one by one compartment in CVP-A.  This water boiling to leach out the dextran from the pan.
[3/8/25, 11:26:31 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: ‎Jarjolen Jamora added ~ Anthony Sanchez
[3/8/25, 11:27:53 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Thanks Jarj
[3/8/25, 11:33:36 AM] Skip Tan: We can do this Sir but not right now since no space to drop the compartment with remaining poor massecuite.
[3/8/25, 11:39:26 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: The situation slowly normalizes, the main concern is still the C-masse in the 3 CVCs having a very poor and bad quality.

‎[3/8/25, 11:42:11 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: ‎image omitted
[3/8/25, 11:43:28 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: This is still the remnants of A-masse in the CVP having a wide varity of grain sizes which has a very poor purging quality
[3/8/25, 11:44:31 AM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: The c seed quality now is also improving APs and C masse also improving.
[3/8/25, 11:45:39 AM] R Babu: Again quality seems fine dust and needle but quality is far better than yesterday
[3/8/25, 11:46:54 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: My findings... there is no substantial dextran formation...the problem mainly caused by too much recirculation of panfloor materials resulting to extremely high viscosities causing poor sugar crystal formation.
[3/8/25, 11:49:07 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: The grains cannot grow in size normaly because we are operating at a very low purity materials
[3/8/25, 11:57:02 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: As the process keeps on improving now, I will stop pan dosing on magma developing and A-masse leaving only and injecting to C-masse and B-masse.
[3/8/25, 12:28:53 PM] R Babu: Yes, Once viscosity reduced pan aid shall be stopped in A seed pan.
[3/8/25, 12:31:13 PM] R Babu: FEJ pty is 74 and MJ and CJ pty is around 72-73, balance the syrup accordingly for B seed and C seed.
[3/8/25, 12:32:20 PM] R Babu: CVP-B how many compartment syrup fed.
[3/8/25, 12:33:05 PM] R Babu: Pressurised hot water temperature is 79 only, why it is fluctuating often.
[3/8/25, 12:33:56 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: we reduced to 2 cells sir
[3/8/25, 12:36:06 PM] R Babu: last sample pty is around 69. Please be monitor, since the syrup pty is dropping now
[3/8/25, 12:37:36 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir, we will monitor and adjust accordingly
[3/8/25, 2:02:16 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Mark, let us 2 mills now

[3/8/25, 2:10:53 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Ok, once the A-masse produce by A-CVP can be easily purged by BMAs and TKs, let the C-mill resume optn. I expect this to be on the next 3-4 hrs.
[3/8/25, 2:17:22 PM] Skip Tan: Noted Sir.
[3/8/25, 2:21:02 PM] R Babu: Mac, C magma pty is improving good. But B magma pty reduced. Please check the B centrifugal for the optimum washing and B massecuite quality.
[3/8/25, 2:28:10 PM] R Babu: Mac, any cigar process condensate water is mixing in pressurised tank or only V1 condensate.
‎[3/8/25, 2:29:49 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: ‎image omitted
[3/8/25, 2:32:42 PM] R Babu: Quality seems good. what is the colour. In daily lab sheet last colour is 4038. This colour seems good. Ask them to measure the colour.
[3/8/25, 2:33:04 PM] R Babu: Is it sugar from BMA & TK
[3/8/25, 2:39:08 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: WS titan Mr Babu
[3/8/25, 2:46:44 PM] R Babu: OK. Thanks what is the colour
[3/8/25, 2:48:18 PM] Skip Tan: Not yet posted Sir.
1300H is 3183.
[3/8/25, 2:51:08 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir
[3/8/25, 2:52:33 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: CVP-A 10 cells on syrup feed sir. We will further monitor
[3/8/25, 2:52:47 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: as of now, all HG ACBs are on operation
[3/8/25, 2:52:52 PM] R Babu: OK. The sample posted by Mr. Marlow sugar colour will be less.
[3/8/25, 2:53:09 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: TK #4 resumed operation at 1445H.
[3/8/25, 2:53:26 PM] R Babu: Good mac, what is the machine massecuite loading
[3/8/25, 2:54:25 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: 60-70 sir
[3/8/25, 2:57:55 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Hanzel/Lyod, rated na ang A-mill at 52-54Hz
[3/8/25, 3:10:03 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Ongoing checking of TK #4 due to imbalance/frequent trip

[3/8/25, 4:12:43 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: Update on HG TK#4: As per John Roel, they will dismantle the basket for internal check up and possible shell balancing due to excessive vibration even at no load. Fyi
[3/8/25, 5:16:32 PM] R Babu: Again C & B magma pty is reducing. Increase the wash water in centrifugal.  B molasses brix is 87-88, very high, increase the wash water and check the massecuite for viscosity.
[3/8/25, 5:18:53 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Noted sir. Earlier, we had problems with insufficient condensate supply in LG.
[3/8/25, 5:21:10 PM] R Babu: The reports are of 4 pm. what is the present pty. What is the wash water timing in HG
[3/8/25, 5:30:05 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: 4,4 sir
‎[3/8/25, 5:31:06 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: ‎image omitted
[3/8/25, 5:31:33 PM] R Babu: Still A molasses load is there. Where is the A molasses consumption  now.
[3/8/25, 5:32:17 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: 3 cells syrup, 7 cells A-mol
[3/8/25, 5:32:41 PM] R Babu: What about in  C boiling
[3/8/25, 5:38:21 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Footing: 40% syrup, 10% A-molasses
[3/8/25, 5:39:03 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Then we top 20% syrup, 20 % A-molasses
[3/8/25, 5:43:36 PM] R Babu: Balance 10 % is it B molasses
[3/8/25, 5:44:28 PM] R Babu: What about CVP -C
[3/8/25, 5:50:05 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: 90% is the strike level to prevent condenser water entrainment
[3/8/25, 5:50:27 PM] R Babu: 2nd shift C-M/C average pty is 56.50 and C-seed average pty is 68. Top up make it syrup 10 % and balance A molasses. So that A molasses consumption will be high. Once the pty balanced top up syrup shall be stopped.
[3/8/25, 5:50:41 PM] R Babu: OK
[3/8/25, 5:51:10 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: 7 cells B-mol, 5 cells condensate
[3/8/25, 5:51:23 PM] R Babu: Increase the HG centrifugal wash timing  5, 5. Increase the A molasses pty
[3/8/25, 5:52:09 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: All noted sir
[3/8/25, 5:53:38 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: HG ACBs affected resumed at 1745H
[3/8/25, 5:54:16 PM] R Babu: Syrup pty is 71+ and B magma pty is around 82, but A-massecuite pty is 70. How come, either sampling is error or inversion happening in CVP A.  Hope magma sampling done at pan floor magma tank.
[3/8/25, 5:55:45 PM] R Babu: Mac, kindly post the picture of B - massecuite and B magma
[3/8/25, 6:16:22 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Guys, be ready....C-mill to resume by 7pm

‎[3/8/25, 6:19:08 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: ‎image omitted
[3/8/25, 6:22:58 PM] R Babu: B magma is good,  but pty is 82.
[3/8/25, 6:23:28 PM] R Babu: B massecuite grain size shall be improved further
[3/8/25, 6:24:16 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We will cut-in and stabilize first Battery B sir then we will give signal to run C-mill. This is communicated with @639274613412. @639176266368
[3/8/25, 6:27:41 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Grain size is good sir, however B massecuite is still viscous/sticky. Grains were washed to obtain a clear picture that's why grains seem smaller than in actual
[3/8/25, 6:30:31 PM] R Babu: OK. Even though the pty is around 66. Increase the wash water timing in HG and increase water wash in B centrifugals also
[3/8/25, 6:34:40 PM] R Babu: How many HG centrifugal machine is running
‎[3/8/25, 7:15:53 PM] ~ Ronalee: ‎image omitted
[3/8/25, 7:45:39 PM] R Babu: Mac, still B & D vacuum raising not yet started
[3/8/25, 8:54:58 PM] R Babu: 7 pm B molasses brix is 91 & pty is 38.54. B-M/C brix is 96.52, when the viscosity is high, brix should be less. Maintain between 94-95 which will facilitate fluidity and increase the B mol pty.  Apart from that increase the wash water in B-centrifugal
[3/8/25, 8:56:03 PM] R Babu: A-M/C stock is again building up. How many HG centrifugal machine is running
[3/8/25, 9:02:58 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: 6 ACBs running sir. Good eve
[3/8/25, 9:03:09 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: We will adjust sir
[3/8/25, 9:05:23 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: The startup of Batt B was not carried out due to leakage at  the flange of 1st cell control valve which cause burning incident involving instru personnel. We decided not to operate it until we ensure the integity of the equipment is secured. Until then, we will wait till battery D mechanical cleaning is done. ETC is around 0200H. After this, we can start C mill for two mills operation. 🙏
[3/8/25, 9:13:55 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: Mills please ensure that C mill performs pre startup testing and balancing. Coordinate closely with Raw House and COGEN to avoid further delay. Thank you.
[3/8/25, 9:17:56 PM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Yes sir.
‎[3/8/25, 9:27:23 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: ‎image omitted
[3/8/25, 9:30:44 PM] R Babu: Why 6 machine Cris, due to A mol load or any issue in other machines
[3/8/25, 9:31:54 PM] R Babu: What is the present machine loading %
[3/8/25, 9:33:03 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: A3,A5,Titan,BMA 2,BMA 3, Tk 5

These are all the machine that can operate sir
[3/8/25, 9:35:22 PM] R Babu: what about other machine. A1 feed valve defective & TK4 vibration .
[3/8/25, 9:35:38 PM] R Babu: whether TK4 basket removed for vibration testing.
[3/8/25, 9:36:03 PM] R Babu: what is the % of massecuite loading to machine
[3/8/25, 9:36:16 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: I'll check the status sir
[3/8/25, 9:36:59 PM] R Babu: A2 & A4 what is the status
[3/8/25, 9:37:50 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: 75% for BMA and WS, 14s charging at Tk
[3/8/25, 9:38:57 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: For A1 sir, instru team is working in it.
[3/8/25, 9:39:35 PM] R Babu: since syrup at pan floor is less, can we operate the A mill with 10000 TCD rate @ 420 TPH till B battery or D battery ready
[3/8/25, 9:40:08 PM] R Babu: But prior to that A-massecuite stock has to be reduced.
[3/8/25, 9:40:20 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: A4 doesn't have a motor, Ang A2 has a problem in controls, it was scheduled for replacement with tkii this coming OSR,
[3/8/25, 9:40:25 PM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Copy Sir
[3/8/25, 9:41:54 PM] R Babu: OK. Then A1 to be made ready at the earliest.
[3/8/25, 9:42:25 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted sir
[3/8/25, 9:43:50 PM] R Babu: Jelyn please check the A massecuite and B massecuite again. Since A molasses and B molasses brix is high again, may be due to high viscous, massecuite fluidity is less and water wash timing is less
[3/8/25, 9:44:11 PM] R Babu: whether HG centrifugal washing increased to 5 5
[3/8/25, 9:44:13 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted sir, cris is checking it right now
[3/8/25, 9:44:56 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: As per the maintenance team, it was scheduled tomorrow.
[3/8/25, 9:45:21 PM] ~ Rey Eran Valiente: A-mill was already at rated speed. we will endeavor to mill @420 tph sir.
[3/8/25, 9:45:34 PM] R Babu: Let us check the B-Massecuite & B molasses pty at 10 PM and if the pty not raised, syrup has to be increased in the CVP-B
[3/8/25, 9:45:48 PM] R Babu: OK. Thanks
[3/8/25, 9:46:02 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Currently 5 cells feeding syrup at CVP-B
[3/8/25, 9:46:42 PM] R Babu: why tomorrow, basket shall be moved to workshop today and tomorrow they can do the vibration test.
[3/8/25, 9:47:12 PM] R Babu: Let us wait for 10 PM sample pty and decide
[3/8/25, 9:47:57 PM] R Babu: Whether any issue in fluidity, please add lubrication molasses in the A massecuite and B massecuite gutter
[3/8/25, 9:49:48 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: I'll ask sir john sir,
[3/8/25, 9:50:07 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Washing at HG since the morning shift is at 3,3 sir. This is to  prevent A-mol tank from getting full quickly that will cause basket stoppages at HG station. Once A-mol level stabilizes we will increase washing
[3/8/25, 9:51:39 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: I'm coordinating now with sir john roel sir,
[3/8/25, 9:52:41 PM] R Babu: Cris, increase the water wash so that purity will increase and non sugar will move out and A molasses consumption will be faster in B-seed, C-seed and CVP-B. As otherwise again all purity will drop .
[3/8/25, 9:53:17 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Copy sir
[3/8/25, 9:53:52 PM] R Babu: Increase immediately 4 4 and let us check the pty and increase further. KIndly do the molasses lubrication also which will facilitate ease purging.

[3/8/25, 10:04:22 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We will adjust HG washing accordingly, as to balance the pan boiling materials  level.
[3/8/25, 10:05:00 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Electrical team will now disconnect ACB #4 (tkii)
[3/8/25, 10:12:22 PM] R Babu: whether the massecuite fluidity is OK. Since the brixes are high. If the fluidity is OK, no need of molasses. I am doubtful for the massecuite fluidity since the molasses brix is high
[3/8/25, 10:16:33 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: a massecuite still manageable sir at high grade, no observe high vibration to ACBs (if massecuite brix is very high, we will observe high vibration in our ACBs). But still we will monitor and do the needful.

[3/8/25, 10:25:38 PM] R Babu: A- seed shall be washed further in the low level to reduce the smaller grains. At the same time massecuite pty should be increased further by increasing B magma pty
[3/8/25, 10:28:56 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: This is noted sir
[3/8/25, 11:11:10 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: What is the latest raw sugar color Cris?
[3/8/25, 11:11:55 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: 3500 IU 10 pm sir
[3/8/25, 11:13:09 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: Is Bmol diversion to fmol still on going cris?
[3/8/25, 11:15:36 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Yes sir
[3/8/25, 11:17:04 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: What is important now is to liquidate or deslodge the old and bad process matls that saturate our  panfloor/centrifugal stns and replace with new ones so we can be back to normal optn. The earliest we can operate 2 mills, the better.
[3/8/25, 11:23:37 PM] R Babu: Hope Cris partial B molasses is going to Final molasses. Since B molasses load is 54% and C-M/C pty in the 3rd shift is 50.5 . Kindly check.
[3/8/25, 11:24:47 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Yes sir. Part of B-mol is going to Fmol
[3/8/25, 11:26:41 PM] R Babu: 10 PM B-M/C pty is 66.60 increased from 63. Maintain same 5 cell syrup feed to B-CVP. If the pty raised to 67 & above reduce the syrup one by one compartment.  B molasses pty improved to 41.42 from 38 pty.
[3/8/25, 11:31:39 PM] R Babu: Further increase the wash water in B- centrifugal to increase the B magma pty and once the B molasses pty reaches around 43 stop diverting to molasses. Maintain C-M/C pty around 52.

[3/8/25, 11:48:51 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: On going hydrotesting and servicing of control valves/ brix transmitter of Battery D
[3/8/25, 11:49:52 PM] R Babu: Any issue in control valve and BT
[3/8/25, 11:51:21 PM] R Babu: what is the B battery Control valve status
[3/8/25, 11:51:47 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: No sir, just na normal servicing
[3/8/25, 11:51:58 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We will check it tomorrow sir
[3/8/25, 11:52:36 PM] R Babu: OK
[3/8/25, 11:56:05 PM] R Babu: Please check thoroughly since it causes burn injury. Safety should be followed strictly 100 % to avoid accident.
[3/9/25, 12:34:29 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: HG A1 ACB resumed at 2350H

[3/9/25, 4:29:25 AM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: Mills and Raw house  team please endeavor to mill continously . Coordinate with COGEN if you need steam support.
[3/9/25, 4:29:54 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Copy Sir
[3/9/25, 4:30:12 AM] ~ Nelson Delfin: Requested Mills to run for minimum rate for CMill until Batt D pumps syrup and stabilizes.
[3/9/25, 4:30:30 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: When C mill started I already talked to Cogen SIC to maintain exhaust pressure at 15psig sir ‎<This message was edited>
[3/9/25, 4:31:55 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Copy meg, will adjust cmill milling rate.
[3/9/25, 6:12:59 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Operate 2 mills at rated capacity, Raw Hse can handle this milling rate. Maceration rate should only be 220% on fiber.
[3/9/25, 6:19:15 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Do not ran Evap B as it is unfit to operate because of safety concerns. Marlowe, Skip and Raw Hse UH on duty, let us have a sgort meeting at 0900hr at CCR to discuss and assess our action plans and corrective measures regarding this
[3/9/25, 6:19:34 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: short
[3/9/25, 6:21:04 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good morning sir ADS. Currently MJ, CJ and DSM tanks are full. If we increase the milling rate of C-mill now, we may have to stop it soon to relieve the high level.
[3/9/25, 6:22:40 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: How about the levels of your syrup, A and B mol at the panfloor?
[3/9/25, 6:23:18 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Back end materials are on a manageable level already sir

[3/9/25, 6:24:52 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: 4 am raw syrup brix is 65.90 sir
[3/9/25, 6:25:20 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: I've allowed it to push to 60 to help relieve light juice levels
[3/9/25, 6:27:11 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Good decision, as we are now on the weekend and our Evap A and C are scaled up already.
[3/9/25, 6:29:00 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Our priority now is to lower down the cane inventory and have a continuous milling tomorrow with C-mill
[3/9/25, 6:30:30 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: No evap cleaning today, we will start cleaning tomorrow once A-mill will be on MSDR
[3/9/25, 6:31:54 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Copy sir
[3/9/25, 6:36:50 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Tomorrow, we will clean and boil the A and B CVPs including their weir boxes to get rid of those mess and start fresh and new
[3/9/25, 6:40:09 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Hows the quality of C-masse coming out from CVCs, i expect to deslodge and replace it in 3 days time starting last Friday
[3/9/25, 6:49:21 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Still viscous sir
‎[3/9/25, 6:49:41 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: ‎image omitted
[3/9/25, 6:58:26 AM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Cmill stopped at 0657H due to high level of MJ/CJ/DSM tanks
[3/9/25, 7:23:52 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Still very fine and highly viscuous
[3/9/25, 7:34:24 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: It is very unfortunate that we reach at this point of optn and this did not happened overnight. I am pretty sure that it started even last week and any knowledgeable and competent sugar technologist saw this coming and should have made corrective meaures outright. This is a disaster and expect a huge sugar losses, poor raw sugar quality produce and low milling tonnage by the end of the week as we are by-passing the normal flow processing procedures. Yet, will still take us about 4-5 days to bring it back to normalcy.

[3/9/25, 8:27:01 AM] R Babu: Divert A V1 condensate to Cogen. Cogen tank level is less
[3/9/25, 8:28:17 AM] R Babu: Mill team, whether partial cold water is taken in mill imbibition. Imbibition water temperature is 65
[3/9/25, 8:31:29 AM] R Babu: Karl, what is the HG centrifugal water wash and syrup feed to CVP-B. Is it still 5 compartment.
[3/9/25, 8:33:07 AM] R Babu: A molasses pty is continuously low.
[3/9/25, 8:34:03 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: 4,4 sir. For CVP-B, 5 cells syrup feeding
[3/9/25, 8:36:04 AM] R Babu: HG water wash keep 5 5 . Let us increase the A mol pty so that B -M/C pty will increase.
[3/9/25, 8:38:43 AM] R Babu: Increase the water wash in B centrifugal so that B magma and B molasses pty will increase. B molasses brix is continuously maintaining 85-87. increase the wash water in such a way pty around 44
[3/9/25, 8:40:16 AM] R Babu: How is the massecuite quality now Karl. Still raw sugar colour is 3000-3500.
[3/9/25, 8:51:24 AM] R Babu: Mill team, for imbibition kindly use hot plus cold water combination till condensate level builds up.
[3/9/25, 8:53:06 AM] ~ Dave: Copy sir.

[3/9/25, 10:23:11 AM] R Babu: Mr. Hanzel/ Skip/ Jelyn as discussed both A & C mill will continue upto tomorrow 8 AM and A mill will be stopped by 8 AM for maintenance and A battery for cleaning. Crushing will be continued with C mill. Once A mill is ready by 6 PM to 7 PM, A mill will be lined up and C mill will be stopped. Once A battery is ready for service both the mills will be in operation. Expected time of both mill operation by Monday midnight or tuesday early morning by around 12 am to 2 AM.
[3/9/25, 10:24:04 AM] R Babu: Thanks for the update and inform Ms.Elaine also
[3/9/25, 10:26:03 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Yes Mr. Babu, due to high cane inventory up to now, we have met with the team and decided on this schedule yesterday.
[3/9/25, 10:48:15 AM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: Good morning Mr. Babu and Raw House team,  refinery will stop temporarily  tomorrow for 2 Hrs due to repair of leakage of Hot Water pp1 discharge and header line. After that sugar boiling will resumed.
[3/9/25, 11:22:14 AM] ~ hanzel malayo: A-Mill Scheduled PM Activities on Monday Mar. 10, 2025:

1. Replacement of Mill 4 coupling and build up square shaft of top roller
2. Build-up Shredder Hammers and Balancing if needed 
3. Replacement of worn out blades of CK1 and CK2
4. Replacement loose bolts, damaged slats, and pillow block bearings of both main and side cane carriers
5. Other routine servicing
[3/9/25, 11:25:23 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Let us complete these activities in less than 10hrs.
[3/9/25, 11:26:27 AM] ~ Dave: C Mill intentionally stopped at 0951H-1120H to check CMill shredder due to high vibration reading
[3/9/25, 11:26:59 AM] ~ hanzel malayo: Will endeavour Sir
‎[3/9/25, 12:25:27 PM] ~ Dave: ‎image omitted
[3/9/25, 12:34:24 PM] R Babu: Mill team, both A & C mill FEJ to MJ pty drop is 5 units. Big difference. Please ensure the effective washing of mill pits, cush cush conveyor, shredder pit, juice gutters etc.. Please ensure the effective biocide addition also.
[3/9/25, 12:35:59 PM] R Babu: Stale cane is also one of the reason due to prolong waiting of cane in the factory and field, but we will ensure in the plant effective mill sanitation. Mr. Hanzel and team please take special attention. Thanks
[3/9/25, 12:38:30 PM] ~ Alex Dungon: This is noted sir
[3/9/25, 12:43:06 PM] R Babu: Karl, Whether TK4 basket removed and sent to workshop for vibration check
[3/9/25, 12:52:22 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Not yet, sir. The RM inspected the machine and found that the bottom valve cylinder with rotary distributor shafting's was deformed
[3/9/25, 12:53:16 PM] R Babu: Karl, CVP C vacuum is less. It is 145 mbar to 152 mbar. Whether the cooling tower is in closed loop.
[3/9/25, 12:54:25 PM] R Babu: So no need to remove the basket.
[3/9/25, 12:54:43 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir, it's in closed loop. I will revert back to malihao supply once water basin level is at lower side
[3/9/25, 12:55:45 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes, sir. After repair and reinstalling, we will test again to assess if vibration problem is rectified
[3/9/25, 12:56:14 PM] R Babu: Please avoid closed loop. Just we are coming out from the problem again vacuum issue aggravate the problem and we will be in issue again
[3/9/25, 12:56:46 PM] R Babu: How many HG basket is running
[3/9/25, 12:57:53 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Okay sir
[3/9/25, 12:58:15 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: 7 ACBs are running sir
[3/9/25, 12:58:26 PM] R Babu: Mill team, reduce the hot water to mill imbibition further and add more raw water, we have to build up the condensate.
[3/9/25, 1:38:13 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Update for TK#4, found no problem with the rotary distributor shafting. For pull-out of basket shell. Informed electrical to pull-out motor
[3/9/25, 1:41:57 PM] R Babu: OK. Thanks for the update
[3/9/25, 1:42:55 PM] R Babu: Karl, C.J tank level is building up, syrup level in the pan floor is less. Please push the syrup to pan to increase the CVP-A throughput
[3/9/25, 2:03:26 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir

[3/9/25, 6:38:19 PM] R Babu: Karl, reduce syrup to CVP-B to 4 compartment. Syrup is getting loaded. B-Massecuite pty is continuously maintaining 67, hence reduce syrup to CVP-B
[3/9/25, 7:19:59 PM] R Babu: Karl, increase the steam pressure, maintain around 16 psig in the exhaust header.
[3/9/25, 7:20:23 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Okay sir. I'll inform cogen
[3/9/25, 7:20:54 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: No Mr. Babu, I want to raise and target 68-72AP so we can improve the B-sugar and B-magma and  improve the A-masse AP and easily produce good and acceptable premium quality raw sugar with minimum ACBs wash time. Otherwise we will use huge amount of condensate washing and thereby consume more steam in the panfloor. High AP A-masse will have a good pan yield and thereby produce more sugar and less molasses. This will minimize recirculation of non-pol or impurities in the system. Remember, pan boiling crystallization operates not only in sugar content but also on the non-pol content of the syrup as well.
[3/9/25, 7:26:25 PM] R Babu: If we maintain 68-72, our purity of B molasses will increase and C-Massecuite pty and final molasses purity. Apart from that we don't require premium raw sugar now. We require sugar colour of 1600 IU only. So far it was maintained like that only. Syrup is also getting loaded, we have to balance crushing and sugar production. 72 purity is too much and it will leads to higher losses. Higher syrup solids in B massecuite will increase the qty and ultimately C massecuite and molasses %.
[3/9/25, 7:34:47 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Sorry but I don't believe in your strategy
[3/9/25, 7:37:32 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: High quality raw sugar thru CBA boiling will  result to improve refining yield and the whole raw and refined sugar optn.
[3/9/25, 7:44:05 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: My objective to produce good quality A,B and C masse with higher cystal yield and the corresponding raw sugar either at 1600 i.u. color at a minimal washtime. This will result to minimal recirculation of intermediate molasses otherwise viscosity will increase again and will have difficulty in centrifugal purging.
[3/9/25, 7:52:11 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: At higher AP of B-masse will require only minimal washing in the B-centrifugals and more solid/pol will go to the B-sugar and to A-masse/A-sugar. On the contrary, if we reduce the B-masse AP, you will require more washing just to maintain the quality of B-sugar and thereby increasing the volume of B-mol and final mol as well. This is the true essence of CBA or double magma boiling system.
[3/9/25, 11:12:10 PM] ~ Nelson Delfin: Batt B cut in for water boiling at 2140H.

[3/11/25, 6:19:25 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: 3 evaps sir. Batt ACD
[3/11/25, 6:21:24 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: A and D are newly cleaned, but C is not. What is your operating assessment of Evap C, we need to clean today.
[3/11/25, 6:23:44 AM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: The plan sir is to clean today if Batt B is already fit for operation.
[3/11/25, 6:24:52 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Marl, do we still have leakages on juice and calandria side of Evap B, 1st cell?
‎[3/11/25, 6:25:50 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: ‎video omitted
[3/11/25, 6:26:07 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: As per latest hydrotesting, there are still leaks on the pre evap juice side
[3/11/25, 6:27:28 AM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: We will address the leakage today and hydrotest again.
[3/11/25, 6:30:07 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Marlowe/Skip, give outmost priority on the repair of these leakages. Assign 2 or more welders to work and a Raw Hse UH to focus on this...ASAP
[3/11/25, 6:35:11 AM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: Noted on this sir. We'll do.
[3/11/25, 6:35:31 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Cris/Nelson, maintain evap brix above 65. Coordinate with Boiler UH to increase the exhaust steam pressure, it is low at 12psig only. Have the temp corrected by Instru, the 126F is wrong.
[3/11/25, 6:42:29 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Copy sir. They will change the UoM. The reading is correct
[3/11/25, 6:43:37 AM] Skip Tan: Latest leak is near the flange.
[3/11/25, 6:44:02 AM] Skip Tan: We will recheck and repair.
[3/11/25, 6:45:53 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Skip, we this done today. Inform me and Marlowe whatever support or logistics you need.
[3/11/25, 6:47:13 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: So it should be on deg.C not deg.F
[3/11/25, 6:47:55 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Yes sir
[3/11/25, 6:53:31 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: All our condensate levels are safe and entrained free
[3/11/25, 6:57:59 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Marlowe, reduce our input raw sugar color to the refinery. Change your blending ratio if necessary, it should not go beyond 2200i.u.

[3/11/25, 8:58:39 AM] R Babu: Good Morning. Skip/ Jelyn please start C double purging and Mr. Murugesan please coordinate. Plan well in advance for Clt consumption in C seed so that Syrup & A molasses ratio shall be adjusted accordingly.
[3/11/25, 9:01:19 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Good AM Mr. Babu, I will defer this double purging for a while and will decide later on....thanks
[3/11/25, 9:02:22 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Our target raw sugar color production is 2000 i.u. as agreed
[3/11/25, 9:08:51 AM] R Babu: OK.  Any specific reason.  It is not only colour, it will help to reduce the molasses % and pty, so that sugar losses will be less when compares with single purging.
[3/11/25, 9:14:25 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: We will observe further, if we can reduce the AP and volume of final mol with normal single C-purging the better. I observe that the mol%cane for the past weeks optn is still high. If the APs of B and low grade mat'ls are very high, then we will commence C-masse double purging.
[3/11/25, 9:20:40 AM] R Babu: Skip, B pre evaporator juice line is isolated, earlier plan is to operate without Pre evaporator.
[3/11/25, 9:25:24 AM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
But due to recent accident, intensive repair was done also reconnected pre-evap.
[3/11/25, 9:26:44 AM] Skip Tan: Leak was found near the flange, which is currently being work on now.
[3/11/25, 9:29:22 AM] R Babu: OK. Thanks Skip for update
[3/11/25, 9:36:25 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Thanks also Mr. Babu for your consideration and continued support to our operation.
[3/11/25, 9:51:55 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Mr. Babu, we will stop 2 mills in the next 1-2hrs to repair the heavy leaks of 45b-28b PRDS, logistics preparation is being done by Mr. Jo and the Boiler team
‎[3/11/25, 9:52:14 AM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: ‎video omitted
[3/11/25, 9:53:44 AM] R Babu: Thanks for update. Yes I have seen the message in Cogen power.
[3/11/25, 9:55:30 AM] Skip Tan: Welcome Sir.
Once ready, we will put it online in preparation for cleaning of Batt-C.
[3/11/25, 11:02:04 AM] ~ lloyd: Amill stpd 1055H

[3/11/25, 11:28:20 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Steam transformer also stopped as per cogen SIC.
[3/11/25, 12:12:31 PM] R Babu: B-M/C pty is almost 72. Please kindly check the syrup addition to B-CVP. Regulate the syrup addition to B-CVP. Mr. Murugesan please do the needful.
[3/11/25, 12:12:31 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Expected mill stoppages is 4hrs to repair the steam leaks
[3/11/25, 12:14:29 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Karl, stop syrup feeding to B-masse, shift to full A-mol feeding now.
[3/11/25, 12:15:30 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir
[3/11/25, 12:17:23 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: 10 cells Amol feeding to CVP-B
[3/11/25, 12:20:19 PM] ~ Murugesan: Ok sir
[3/11/25, 12:39:37 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Skip/Karl, reduce the washtimes of HG ACBs to the minimum and the B-CCBs as well as we are now getting good quality raws. With this procedure, expect more sugar production to the front end and lesser molasses going to the backend.
[3/11/25, 12:40:15 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Remember, target color is still 2,000 i.u.
[3/11/25, 12:42:37 PM] R Babu: Good. Please monitor the purity and balance the syrup accordingly.
[3/11/25, 12:43:21 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: This is noted sir
[3/11/25, 12:43:27 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir
[3/11/25, 12:51:40 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: This pan boiling scheme reduces the recirculation of pol and non-pol in the system thereby reduces drastically the viscosity formation of panfloor matls which grossly lenghening the rate of crystallization.

‎[3/11/25, 4:09:18 PM] Skip Tan: ‎image omitted
[3/11/25, 4:36:27 PM] R Babu: So this week option A without double purging and next week option B with double purging
[3/11/25, 4:37:23 PM] Skip Tan: For now without double purge but once C-Masse AP increases to 55, we will do double purge.
[3/11/25, 4:39:14 PM] R Babu: In my opinion option A Pty of B-M/C, C-M/C and molasses purity is high for the cane quality we are processing. It may leads to higher sugar losses. Any how since the team agreed upon, let us implement. In this scheme lot syrup will be consumed in B & C boiling which will increase the molasses %.
[3/11/25, 5:03:02 PM] ~ Anthony Sanchez: Mr. Babu, let the results speak for itself. You have implemented your scheme and the outcome is not good. You can try again next week when you arrive and find out the results for yourself....thanks

[3/13/25, 11:30:27 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: As per the maintenance team they will reroute the line on Monday.
[3/13/25, 11:35:25 AM] R Babu: All Juice tank levels are high, whereas pan syrup tank level is less. Karl, push the syrup to pan floor and maximise the syrup feed to CVP-A and maximise the sugar production
[3/13/25, 11:37:16 AM] R Babu: Please optimize the syrup addition to B boiling.
[3/13/25, 11:37:32 AM] R Babu: Consume maximum syrup solids to A boiling.
[3/13/25, 11:39:25 AM] Skip Tan: Strategies for improvement:
1. To lower B-magma AP, reduction in washwater was done yesterday but did not lower the AP to target of 88. We will instead stop syrup to CVP-B and observe the succeeding analysis. This will also increase Syrup volume for A-masse.
2. Noticed slow boiling in CVPs subjected to 3 weeks continuous boiling. We will revert back to 2 weeks continuous operation for CVP-A & B (water boiling of 1 section per week).
3. Refinery reject AP will be reduced back to 73.
4. During double purging, C-light molasses will be maintained at 60-65 AP.
[3/13/25, 11:39:42 AM] R Babu: Our molasses % cane is too high, earliest start up of double purging is better. Skip/ Jelyn/ Murugesan please discuss with Sir Arnel also, if required we can have short meeting now
[3/13/25, 11:42:38 AM] Skip Tan: We will double purge after optimization of CCBs Sir.
[3/13/25, 11:42:39 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Noted sir. We will maintain 60-62 bx for our syrup
[3/13/25, 11:43:06 AM] R Babu: Yes Skip, right direction. Agreed and implement immediately.
[3/13/25, 11:45:31 AM] R Babu: Regarding double purging if the pty below 60 after the weekend start up, there should be plan B to accommodate the Clt molasses in CVP-C or C -seed filling up and adjust the ration of C-seed. This plan B shall be derived from after discussion with Mr.Murugesan
[3/13/25, 12:01:29 PM] Skip Tan: Noted Sir.
[3/13/25, 12:02:05 PM] Skip Tan: We will discuss possible scenarios.
[3/13/25, 12:50:47 PM] R Babu: Exhaust pressure is 16 pisg and V1 is 10 psig, whereas steam consumption is 255-260. Very low, please check whether 1st effect boiling is OK, and how many pans are boiling in refinery.
[3/13/25, 12:51:14 PM] R Babu: Massecuite brixes are also low. Whether pans are getting sufficient vapour.
[3/13/25, 12:52:52 PM] R Babu: If steam consumption is 255-260, it will end up with piling house stock and exhaustion will be less and we may loose sugar.  Please check the reasons for lower steam consumption
[3/13/25, 12:53:30 PM] Skip Tan: Refinery is on slowdown Sir due to breakdown of CT fan stack.
[3/13/25, 12:53:48 PM] Skip Tan: Will try to balance at evaporators.
[3/13/25, 12:55:27 PM] R Babu: But still may be 3 module is running. Mr. Marlow how many modules are running now. Try to balance the number of pan operation to avoid the back pressure so that pan will get sufficient vapour and exhaustion will not be issue

[3/13/25, 1:13:10 PM] Skip Tan: @639162655633, schedule the repair immediately.
[3/13/25, 1:14:44 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. Materials needed for replacement are already fabricated, will coordinate with the structural for repair
[3/13/25, 1:20:28 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: Only 2 VP and 2 Modules Mr. Babu
[3/13/25, 1:23:47 PM] R Babu: What about recovery pan and what is the temperature of cold water
[3/13/25, 1:28:36 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: 2 small VP at recovery.  temp.32C and pres is only 20psig
[3/13/25, 1:34:50 PM] R Babu: Temperature seems OK, how many pumps are running
[3/13/25, 1:43:52 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: 1 Hot water pump and 1 Cold pump. Only one cell is operating. While the fan stack is under repair.
[3/13/25, 1:55:06 PM] R Babu: Can we start 2 hot water pump and 2 cold water pump. Even though one cell is not in service, let water flow through the two cells, there will be some natural draft and some cooling will be there. Observe the temperature for sometime and increase the VP to suit the vacuum.
[3/13/25, 2:08:42 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: We cannot do that at this point because of the on going repair inside the stack fan broken fiberglass portion. It is too risky to the people performing job.
[3/13/25, 2:09:33 PM] ~ Marlowe A. Lugador: As per John Roel they will finish the repair at around 1800H.
[3/13/25, 2:11:53 PM] R Babu: OK. Anything unsafe not at all advisable
[3/13/25, 3:24:43 PM] Skip Tan: Raw Sugar team, Cogen⁩ will maintain 245tph steam generation for factory until 1800H or until Refinery resumes full swing.
258tph imbalances the pressure drop distribution of evaporator due to slowdown of refinery.
[3/13/25, 3:26:28 PM] R Babu: OK. Good. Maintain required back pressure of exhaust and V1 so that pan boiling will not affect.

[3/13/25, 4:53:01 PM] Arnel Amparo: The magma lines had been steamed already. So we’re ready for double purging. What else do we have to do , Skip and Karl?
[3/13/25, 5:08:07 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Good afternoon sir. We are waiting for the C-magma 1 cyclone analysis from QA, this will pre-determine the c lte purity if we start double purging now. If the resulting AP is above 60, we will start double purging right away.
[3/13/25, 5:11:23 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: c-magma cyclone analysis
Bx: 82.50
Pol: 44.40
AP: 53.82
[3/13/25, 5:12:11 PM] R Babu: What is C magma pty.
[3/13/25, 5:16:55 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: The latest C-magma AP is 73.77 sir
[3/13/25, 5:21:50 PM] R Babu: With 74 pty, C-lt pty of 60 is difficult. Water wash has to be increased in the C-double purging. C1 magma pty shall be around 78 to manage the Clt pty.
[3/13/25, 5:23:22 PM] R Babu: But please start double purging and check the Clt molasses pty from the machine outlet. Keep sufficient water. Since molasses % is continuously higher.
[3/13/25, 5:26:35 PM] Skip Tan: We will start 1 CCB for double purging and balance the feeding to CVP-C.
[3/13/25, 5:27:04 PM] Skip Tan: If AP improves, we will shift it to C-graining.
[3/13/25, 5:28:11 PM] R Babu: Yes so that we can ascertain the Clt and C magma pty. Mr. Murugesan please help to determine the C double purged sugar visible colour requirement and guide the team accordingly
[3/13/25, 5:28:50 PM] Arnel Amparo: Ask help of QA  to analyze frequently the C light purity, so we’ll be guided where to feed it.
[3/13/25, 5:29:35 PM] R Babu: Yes frequent sampling to guide the SIC to take the necessary action in time.
[3/13/25, 5:30:01 PM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
The three of us just finished the discussion.
[3/13/25, 5:32:01 PM] ~ Murugesan: 👍
[3/13/25, 5:32:03 PM] R Babu: Good. Now we have to monitor and increase the wash water in HG centrifugal also. Since we have stopped the syrup in CVP-B, B magma pty will be dropped and it will increase the raw massecuite colour, this will be compensated with additional wash water.
[3/13/25, 5:38:12 PM] Skip Tan: Correct Sir.
Since the washwater reduction in B-CCB does not affect much the AP of magma, we instead stop syrup feeding to CVP-B. ‎<This message was edited>
[3/13/25, 5:39:21 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We will do steaming of C-magma 1 pump sir. Motor load is high resulting in VFD fault.  We will resume immediately if all is good.
[3/13/25, 5:42:45 PM] R Babu: Good.
[3/13/25, 5:44:54 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Noted sir, we will add 1 second for 1st wash time
[3/13/25, 5:47:45 PM] Skip Tan: Currently, C1 magma AP is down to 71, even though we are increasing 1st purging washwater and f-mol Brix is already 85. Sir @918056290588 suggests to increase washing to get 78 AP of C1-magma to get high C-light molasses AP.
My thought is we are doing double purging to reduce the washwater used in 1st purge to reduce f-mol volume while maintaining 87-90 Bx. But doing so will reduce C1 magma AP to get high C-light AP.
Sir @918750599666, is it ok to increase more the washwater for 1st purging to increase C1-magma AP but get F-mol Brix below 85?
[3/13/25, 5:53:19 PM] R Babu: If C1 magma pty is 71, in 2nd purging it is difficult to Clt pty 60 and C sugar pty around 85. Hence increase the wash water in C single purging so that pty will increase.  Yes if the molasses brix goes less than 85 is ok, as long as molasses pty is on par with the requirement.
[3/13/25, 5:59:29 PM] Arnel Amparo: Skip it’s okay to increase washing for first purging to improve C 1 magma , and then to maintain Clight purity. At the same time, let’s improve C massecuite purity to 52-53 %
[3/13/25, 6:02:01 PM] Skip Tan: These are noted Sir @918750599666 and Sir @639177090719. After starting 1CCB for double purge, we will adjust the 1st purge washwater.
[3/13/25, 6:05:34 PM] R Babu: Good, start double purging and pty shall  be balanced by adjusting the water wash after  seeing the purities.
[3/13/25, 6:08:42 PM] ~ Earl John Pabular: Requested mills to reduce milling rate of A-mill due to high tank levels at MJ, CJ, and DSM. ‎<This message was edited>
[3/13/25, 6:10:40 PM] ~ Alex Dungon: Ok already adjusted A- mill milling rate
[3/13/25, 6:12:42 PM] R Babu: Mac, syrup at pan floor is low level. Push the syrup to pan floor with lower brix, so that CVP-A shall be maximised and sugar production
[3/13/25, 6:13:23 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Yes sir, I communicated with Earl to adjust syrup brix to 60.
[3/13/25, 6:22:50 PM] R Babu: Skip/ Mac, House stock is so high maximise the sugar production. Let us reduce and maintain the house stock less. Higher house stock will leads to sugar losses over the period.
[3/13/25, 6:31:14 PM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
[3/13/25, 6:33:12 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Double purging started at 1830H with 1 machine only. We will start feeding c lte to CVP-C 1 cell once there is enough stock at c lte tank.
[3/13/25, 6:37:45 PM] R Babu: If the Clt pty is 60, certainly there wont be any circumstance to feed it to CVP-C. It will be balanced in C grain. If the pty drops, feeding to CVP-C is the option.
[3/13/25, 6:39:12 PM] R Babu: Kindly instruct the lab to check the purity every hour till base line purity parameters are established
[3/13/25, 6:42:07 PM] Skip Tan: Already arrange with Miss Ellaine.
We will reduce B-magma analysis and switch with C-light molasses.
[3/13/25, 6:44:52 PM] R Babu: B magma shall be once in 2 hrs
[3/13/25, 7:00:26 PM] Skip Tan: @639981832444 & @639069455128, for C-light molasses target of 60+,
1st purge magma AP of 78-80 or 85 would be the target, this will result to low brix F-mol as long as pump can cater.
[3/13/25, 7:45:43 PM] R Babu: Mac, whether Clt molasses pty analysed .
[3/13/25, 8:09:36 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: we have sample sent to QA sir for 2000H
[3/13/25, 8:13:26 PM] R Babu: A molasses load is continuously high. Whether B-CVP is boiling properly. Please kindly increase the raw massecuite grain size after discussing with Mr. Murugesan.
[3/13/25, 8:17:57 PM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
Boiling was also checked by Sir @918056290588 and can stretch boiling until monday.
[3/13/25, 8:18:47 PM] Skip Tan: Better grain size was also observed.
[3/13/25, 8:20:29 PM] R Babu: Ok. If grain size is better no need. Normally bigger grain size will reduce the molasses load.
[3/13/25, 8:20:54 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We started topping 10% molasses for B grain developing pans sir, this will help reduce A-mol levels.
[3/13/25, 8:21:41 PM] Skip Tan: Yes Sir.
As observed in ACBs, low washwater setting still produce low color sugar.
[3/13/25, 8:22:12 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We will gradually increase A-mol topped depending on B-magma AP
[3/13/25, 8:31:19 PM] R Babu: ok
[3/13/25, 8:31:38 PM] R Babu: Good.
[3/13/25, 8:32:09 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Started c lte feed to CVP-C cell #2 @ 2030H.
[3/13/25, 8:38:54 PM] R Babu: Mac , A massecuite brix is continuously 90. Both 1st and 2nd shift average is 90 only. Latest 2000 hrs sample also 90. Please increase the brix. Lower brix may be one of the reason for higher A molasses.
[3/13/25, 8:42:54 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Noted sir, we will make adjustments to increase A-mass brix.
[3/13/25, 8:44:53 PM] R Babu: yes please increase the brix
[3/13/25, 10:03:41 PM] R Babu: what is the Clt molasses pty
[3/13/25, 10:10:35 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: it's 69.04 sir, I already reduced wash water for 2nd purge as I saw the first sample sent to QA
[3/13/25, 10:11:56 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We already stopped c lte feed to CVP-C and will top up c lte to current c grain
[3/13/25, 10:12:39 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Once c lte feed start, we will add additional machine for 2nd purge.
[3/13/25, 10:13:23 PM] ~ Murugesan: Good
[3/13/25, 10:13:37 PM] R Babu: Good that after seeing the pty, immediately remedial action taken. Good.
[3/13/25, 10:13:57 PM] ~ Murugesan: Start 2 basket please
[3/13/25, 10:15:52 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Noted sir, we will start the 2nd machine now
[3/13/25, 10:18:17 PM] R Babu: Mac, once base line parameters are achieved, you can normalize the double purging.
[3/13/25, 10:27:06 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir
[3/13/25, 10:44:27 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Reduced washing for all 1st purge machines since our c lte pty is higher than the target of 60.
[3/13/25, 10:45:00 PM] ~ Murugesan: Mr Marc please control the C lite purity 
Last sample purity is 70
[3/13/25, 10:47:05 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Yes sir, washing is already at minimum for 2nd purge. Reduced also washing for 1st purge machines as this is the major factor why c lte pty is higher.
[3/13/25, 10:58:44 PM] R Babu: Please monitor continuously so that fine tuning shall be done
[3/13/25, 11:03:42 PM] R Babu: where is the V1 condensate diversion
[3/13/25, 11:07:04 PM] ~ Justine Cientos: Batt A V1 to SCT
Batt D V1 to Flash Cigar
[3/13/25, 11:07:13 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: All three second purge machines are operational at 2345H.
[3/13/25, 11:07:39 PM] R Babu: Very good Mac. Thanks a lot
[3/13/25, 11:08:39 PM] R Babu: Change A V1 to cigar and D V1 to SCT. BST tank levels are low.

[3/14/25, 12:31:40 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Double purging stopped at 0030H due to full C-light molasses tank. Will resume once C-seed pan starts taking in C-light molasses
[3/14/25, 12:37:50 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Increased A-mol topping to B-seed developing to 15%
[3/14/25, 12:38:24 AM] R Babu: Within 45 minutes of starting all 3 machines, tank full. What about BMA 1 & 2. Whether both pans are in service now.
[3/14/25, 12:39:40 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Only bma 2 is operational sir.
[3/14/25, 12:40:40 AM] R Babu: Can we plan advance C grain so that Clt shall be accommodated.
[3/14/25, 12:42:16 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: If we use both pans sir, the other pan will be standing by for almost half a shift before it can be discharged.
[3/14/25, 12:44:34 AM] R Babu: What about C seed crystalliser position now.
[3/14/25, 12:46:07 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: C-seed tank at 21% now. BMA 2 is now full and undergoing brixing
[3/14/25, 12:47:23 AM] R Babu: If BMA is full and brixing, no issues you can start the BMA 1 for advance grain.
[3/14/25, 12:52:20 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Copy sir
[3/14/25, 12:53:02 AM] R Babu: OK.
[3/14/25, 12:55:54 AM] R Babu: Mr. Murugesan Please make the procedure for advance grain preparation.  When to make advance grain preparation depends upon the pan house position.  This will be helpful for the people in the shift to take decision according to house position
[3/14/25, 1:12:20 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Sir for now, I will expedite brixing of BMA 2. 

Vacuum pump  that can supply to BMA 1 is being used by A seed developing pans because its own vacuum pump delivered poorly during the previous shift.
[3/14/25, 1:13:10 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: PMD made some adjustments to the pump however during testing now, it still cannot achieve 25 inHg vacuum even on close valve

It is under control or full?
[3/14/25, 5:58:02 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good morning sir. C-light tank level is under control. No stoppage since resumption at 0140H
[3/14/25, 6:03:18 AM] ~ Murugesan: Ok good 
Kindly keep on monitor the C lite tank level If more than 70 % start feeding 1 cell to C CVP

[3/14/25, 6:58:46 AM] Arnel Amparo: Ok good . So this is fed to graining. Do we feed syrup also and A molasses?
[3/14/25, 7:00:22 AM] ~ Cris Matthew: Yes sir we are still using syrup and A-mol.

Last graining we used 20% syrup, 15% a-mol and 15% c-light as footing.

[3/14/25, 11:49:25 PM] R Babu: Karl, juice tank levels are high and pan floor syrup tank level is low. Please kindly push the syrup. Sugar production in the 3rd shift is less.
[3/14/25, 11:51:07 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. We will cope up with the production. Syrup brix is adjusted to 60 to be pushed to panfloor
[3/14/25, 11:52:58 PM] R Babu: OK. Who is in 1st shift. Let them maximise the CVP throughput and increase the sugar production.
[3/14/25, 11:55:33 PM] ~ Karl Angelo: Copy sir. We are on 12hrs shift sir
[3/14/25, 11:56:32 PM] R Babu: OK. You will be upto morning 8 am. Maximise the sugar production.
[3/15/25, 12:01:09 AM] R Babu: Jelyn when the level transmitter for Clt molasses tank will be installed
[3/15/25, 12:01:47 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: I'll check the update later sir.
[3/15/25, 12:02:10 AM] R Babu: OK.thanks

[3/15/25, 4:37:15 AM] ~ Nelson Delfin: Requested Mills SIC to reduce Milling Rate due to on going liquidation of Batt C which is due for weekend servicing.
[3/15/25, 4:38:31 AM] ~ Alex Dungon: Ok, A- mill milling rate adjusted as requested by Raw house
[3/15/25, 4:41:10 AM] ~ Nelson Delfin: Batt C Stopped at 0415H. On going liquidation of contents.
[3/15/25, 5:56:03 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Adjusted syrup feeding to CVP-B to 2 cells due to declining Bmasse AP
[3/15/25, 7:02:51 AM] ~ Nelson Delfin: Batt C cut in for Soda Boiling at 0700H.
[3/15/25, 7:03:18 AM] Arnel Amparo: How about Set B?
[3/15/25, 7:03:49 AM] ~ Nelson Delfin: Batt B is already operational since 0345H sir.
[3/15/25, 7:07:06 AM] Arnel Amparo: Ok . Did you operadd re the 1st effect that has a bottom that gave way?
[3/15/25, 7:12:04 AM] ~ Karl Angelo: Yes sir. Hydrotesting was done prior to start-up.

[3/15/25, 8:01:59 AM] R Babu: Good morning.  Mill team the AP difference between FEJ and MJ is 2.68. Which is very high.  please monitor the mill sanitation and maintain effective washing of mill pits, gutter, shredder pit, cush cush conveyors etc.  Since the temperature is high, there is high possibility of receiving stale cane. Possible prevention shall be done from our side. Mill sanitation chemical dosing shall be increased.
[3/14/25, 11:59:49 AM] Skip Tan: Sir @639177090719, we temporarily stopped close-loop due to CVP-C vacuum drop. Cannot maintain optimum operation due to high water temperature.
We will install line from pond 12 to CVP-C nash.
‎[3/14/25, 12:00:20 PM] Skip Tan: ‎image omitted
[3/14/25, 12:14:26 PM] R Babu: Still Dextran level is high. Our raw sugar target dextran is 250 PPM. We are in border line. During April still temperature will go up and impacts the dextran level. We should have sufficient dextranase stock to use during our 100 K sugar production.
[3/14/25, 12:18:26 PM] R Babu: A molasses load is continuously on higher side. Karl, kindly post the B-massecuite grain size picture.
[3/14/25, 12:21:12 PM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: We have stock sir also I already file for supplemental
[3/14/25, 12:21:41 PM] R Babu: CVP- B 1st compartment vacuum is 126 mbar and 2nd compartment is 163 mbar. Vacuum is too low. Steam valve opening is 14 % and 29 % only. Can we increase the vacuum and increase the steam valve opening to maximum to maximise the A molasses consumption in CVP-B
[3/14/25, 12:25:22 PM] ~ lloyd: Resumed 1145H
‎[3/14/25, 12:35:21 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: ‎image omitted
[3/14/25, 12:36:04 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: we will further increase steam supply sir
[3/14/25, 12:38:38 PM] R Babu: Mac, can you post somewhat clear picture. The grain size seems bigger in this picture.
[3/14/25, 12:39:44 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We will make instrumentation check the vacuum for CVP B sec II sir. The vacuum for both section should not have significant difference
[3/14/25, 12:40:14 PM] R Babu: If the grain size is too big, A molasses consumption will be less. More the surface area, lesser will be the sucrose deposition.
‎[3/14/25, 12:42:19 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: ‎image omitted
[3/14/25, 12:46:43 PM] R Babu: First increase the steam supply.
[3/14/25, 12:47:03 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: noted sir
[3/14/25, 12:47:12 PM] R Babu: Can we measure the grain size.
[3/14/25, 12:49:07 PM] R Babu: How many HG centrifugal machine is running. Still sugar production is less.
[3/14/25, 12:49:24 PM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: We will check sir.
[3/15/25, 8:05:19 AM] R Babu: Process team, pty drop between MJ to CJ is 1.87. Which is very high. There should be pty gain. Please check the pH, temperature, evaporator level, hygiene condition in M.J tank, vacuum filter,temperature profile across evaporator etc..
[3/15/25, 8:10:05 AM] R Babu: Increase the limed juice pH from 8.2/ 8.3 to 8.5 and let us observe for some time
[3/15/25, 8:18:56 AM] ~ Rey Eran Valiente: This is noted sir. we will adjust the frequency of our mill washing to every 2hrs and increase the bactericide dosing.
[3/15/25, 8:19:47 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Noted on this sir
[3/15/25, 8:35:01 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Hi sirs @639177090719 @918750599666, right now we have problems with Nash pump #3 ( A seed graining) - poor delivery and Nash pump #6 (B graining) - thinned out pump casing.

We are now coordinating with the maintenance team to give priority to these two.

They will first defer work line up for tkii Basket.
[3/15/25, 8:43:50 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Also, we requested the mill team to adjust the milling rate and maceration (minimum) until Batt C finished soda boiling, steam generated= 305tph, exhaust pressure at 13-14psig.
[3/15/25, 8:47:42 AM] R Babu: Okay
[3/15/25, 8:48:36 AM] Skip Tan: Raw Sugar team, B-magma AP is dropping, we will resume syrup feed to CVP-B (1 cell) for now until magma AP increases. The drop is affected by AP drop from C2-magma, please check if sufficient washing is supplied to 2nd purge. This will reduce syrup for CVP-A but we meed to prioritize AP balance.
[3/15/25, 8:49:05 AM] R Babu: Top priority should be given for A seed grain pump and Nash vacuum pump.
[3/15/25, 8:49:20 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Yes sir.
[3/15/25, 8:50:10 AM] R Babu: What is the issue with A seed grain pump, line got choke or what
[3/15/25, 8:51:04 AM] ~ Jelyn Eusebio Dealagdon: Yes nong skip, we will closely monitor. Karl already started feeding syrup to CVP-B.
[3/15/25, 8:55:19 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: no issue with A grain pump sir. The one with poor delivery is Nash Vacuum pp #3, used for A grain developing pans
[3/15/25, 9:00:42 AM] R Babu: So 2 vacuum pump issues.  Whether RM is attending both.
[3/15/25, 9:03:10 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: they are now working on vac pump #6 sir
[3/15/25, 9:07:30 AM] ~ Marc Eli Dellomes: Maintenance team will replace vacuum pump casing

[3/15/25, 4:56:32 PM] Daddy Globe: Noted Sir. Will check this with our Buyer and have this expedited.
[3/15/25, 4:56:43 PM] Daddy Globe: from robert lau
[3/15/25, 5:01:48 PM] R Babu: Good afternoon sir.  Thanks for your follow up to get the material in time.
[3/15/25, 8:28:29 PM] R Babu: B molasses and B magma pty is less. Increase the water wash in B centrifugal. How many compartments Syrup fed
[3/15/25, 8:31:41 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Good evening sir. 2 cells syrup being fed to CVP - B
[3/15/25, 8:37:05 PM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: C-mill stop 2033H check cane knives no. 2 due to unusual sound
[3/15/25, 8:39:49 PM] R Babu: How long 2 compartment is fed with syrup.
[3/15/25, 8:40:08 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Since last night sir
[3/15/25, 8:51:58 PM] ~ Vincent Van Rendo: Cmill resume 2051H - Replaced 1 pc missing bolt of CK no. 2
[3/15/25, 8:54:27 PM] R Babu: CVP-C vacuum is less. Whether cooling tower water in closed loop.
[3/15/25, 8:55:41 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Cooling tower is in close loop sir to maintain low level of basins. To ensure that the Nash vacuum pumps area will be free from flooding so that maintenance team can work continuously on Nash pump no. 6
[3/15/25, 8:56:28 PM] R Babu: Cris, kindly update the status Nash pump No.3 & 6
[3/15/25, 8:57:19 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Replacement of casing at Nash no. 6 ongoing sir.
[3/15/25, 8:57:51 PM] R Babu: what are all the sources for BTCT now.
[3/15/25, 8:58:44 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: CVP-A, Molasses cooler, CVC and RVF are getting their cooling water from BTCT.
[3/15/25, 9:00:18 PM] R Babu: what is the temperature of BTCT cold and hot water
[3/15/25, 9:08:54 PM] R Babu: Cris, what is the temperature of process cooling tower inlet and outlet temperature. In the system it is showing hot water temperature around 50 and cold water around 38. Is it correct.
[3/15/25, 9:13:03 PM] R Babu: Skip/ Jelyn and Process SIC, we have to find a way to operate the complete pan boiling with optimum vacuum even with closed loop during emergency operation/ continuous operation.  Whether we have to add one cooling tower cell, hot water pump and cold water pump or what is required to operate the plant without disturbance in vacuum.
[3/15/25, 9:15:10 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: Yes sir that is correct
[3/15/25, 9:15:39 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: All available pumps and cells are already operational sir. 5 cold pumps and 5 hot pumps
[3/15/25, 9:20:48 PM] R Babu: Cold water temperature is high, which consumes more water in the pan for condensing and vacuum ejection.
[3/15/25, 9:22:48 PM] R Babu: Instruct someone to check the cold and hot water pump motor current and we can compare with installed motor rating. This will help to ascertain the pump working condition.
[3/15/25, 9:26:00 PM] Skip Tan: BTCT temp perviously was 47 & 49.
We are preparing to transfer molasses cooling to main CT and nash pumps will be priority of BTCT.
This is to improve BTCT temp.
[3/15/25, 9:31:11 PM] R Babu: 2 degree delta T is nothing, it clearly indicates that BTCT is not working properly and overloaded.
[3/15/25, 9:33:00 PM] Skip Tan: Correct Sir.
Even if we bypass portion of water sent to BTCT still the same.
Also we will be cleanining the internals of BTCT.
[3/15/25, 9:33:09 PM] R Babu: Jelyn what is the status of cold water/cooled condensate water line exclusively for C basket for curing. Since summer is approaching, higher molasses temperature to storage is risk and not advisable
[3/15/25, 9:34:21 PM] Skip Tan: No pumps yet.
Can we use hydro water from MT2? This will only need diversion line.
[3/15/25, 9:36:35 PM] R Babu: we can use for time being to C basket only. But we should use hot water for B basket and vacuum filter.
[3/15/25, 9:41:04 PM] Skip Tan: It would also be better to use hot water for 2nd purge.
‎[3/15/25, 9:42:39 PM] ~ Cris Matthew: ‎image omitted
[3/15/25, 9:42:52 PM] R Babu: OK.  Line shall be connected accordingly
[3/15/25, 9:51:12 PM] R Babu: Cris, All pumps are operating under loaded. This also could be one of the reason for lower vacuum. Let RM check the pump one by one.
[3/15/25, 9:53:08 PM] R Babu: Check the pump gland packing and please do proper priming of pump to remove the air in the pump suction so that pumping qty will be maximum
